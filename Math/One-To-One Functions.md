A function is 1-to-1 if no two elements in the [domain](Domain%20of%20Functions.md) of $f$ correspond to the same element in the [range](Range%20of%20Functions.md) of $f$.

Put in other words, each $x$ in the domain has exactly one image in the range. And no $y$ in the range is the image of more then one $x$ in the domain.

### Horizontal line test:

	Not 1-to-1.

If there is no horizontal line which that intersects the graph of $f(x)$ in more then one point, then the function is one-to-one.

### Properties:
1. The domain of  $f$ equals the range of $f^{-1}$ and the range of $f$ equals the domain of $f^{-1}$ .
2. $f^{-1}( f(x) ) = x$ for every x in the domain of $f$ and $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for every x in the domain of $f^{-1}$.
3. The graph of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are symmetric with respect to the line $y = x$.
