This is a broad example of genetic [[Mutation]] and [[Natural Selection Or Evolution]].

In a mixed population of bacteria, some may have resistance towards a specific type of antibiotic. Hence when the [[Antibiotic]] is applied the bacteria which live throughout pass their genes to the next generation, this [[Natural Selection Or Evolution]].

## How bacteria become resistant to antibiotics:
1. A pacient with a bacterial infection takes an [[Antibiotic]], for example penicillium.
2. The infection consists of millions of bacteria of the same species, individuals throughout the population will show variation.
3. Some bacteria will have antibiotic resistance as a result to a random [[Mutation]].
4. Unless the full dose of [[Antibiotic]]s is used then the bacteria with the gene that codes for the antibitic resistance will pass on their genes. ([[Natural Selection Or Evolution]])
5. Number of resistant bacteria will increase - pass to another person potentially
6. Pacient cannot be treated with penicillin anymore.
