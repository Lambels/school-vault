Differences between individuals of the **same species**.

# Phenotypic Variation:
Difference in features between individuals of a species.

Some of these differences are caused and controles by different genes. ([[Genes And Proteins]])
Whilst some are **environmental** and are totally controlled by the environment in which the animal lives in.

## Genetic Variation:
- Blood Group.
- Eye Colour.
- Gender.
- Ability to roll tongue.
- Whether ear lobes are fixed or loaded.

### Sources of Genetic Variation:
- [[Mutation]]s - New alleles form through random changes in DNA sequence.
- [[Meiosis]] - New allele combinations form through segregation.
- Random Mating - Which partnerships form (random).
- Random Fertilisation - Which sperm fertilises the egg (random).

## Environmental Variation:
- Characteristics of all species can be affected by environmental factors.
- Examples:
	- Scarring on the body from a fight.
	- Weight gain from eating too much.
	- Being able to speak your native language.
	- Plant growing taller when staying in light.

There are 2 types of phenotypic variations:
## Continuous Variation:
Continuous variation is when there are very small degrees of variation for a particular characteristic shared between individuals. These values are arranged in order hence can be measured on a scale or range.

Ex: hight, mass, finger length

## Discontinuous Variation:
In this category there are distinct differences between individuals, *its either black or white, no in-between*.

Ex: blood types, rolling tung out (you either can or cant).

## Sources:
- Discontinuous variation is usually caused by genetic variation alone.
- Continuous variation is a mixture of both env. and gen. variation, whilst you may have the genetic potential, your environment will limit you in reaching your potential.
