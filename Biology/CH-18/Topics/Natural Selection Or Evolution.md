- In all populations there is a large range of variation throughout the individuals.
- There is a competition between the excess of individuals in the environment -> struggle for survival -> natural selection.
- Individuals which survive reproduce -> pass on the favourable gene -> greater number of individuals with the wanted characteristic.

## Evolution:
- If the environment does not change the selection remains constant.
	- no driving factor
- If the environment changes, or a chance mutation creates a very favourable variation ([[Mutation]]) selection might now favour the individuals with the new alleles.
- Over time these alleles will become more and more common throughout the species as a result to natural selection.
- Natural selection results in a process of adaptation or **EVOLUTION**.

A good example of evolution is [[Antibiotic Resistance of Bacteria]].
