Mutations are the random genetic changes to the bases of DNA.

Most of the mutations which occur have no effect on the phenotype as the mutated gene that makes the protein works just as well as the non mutated protein.
Yet sometimes, rarely, mutations can lead to the development of new alleles ([[Monohybrid Inheritance]]) hence new phenotypes can occur. If they do still the differences are minimal.

### Beneficial Mutations:
These mutations give a survival advantage -> higher chance to pass the genes on.
- A bird develops colourful feathers -> gets mates more -> pass gene to next generations.

### Non-Beneficial Mutations:
Mutations can contrarily lead to harmful changes that can have dramatic effects on the organism.

An example in humans of non-beneficial mutations is [[Sickle Cell Anaemia]]. (debatable)

### Influencing Mutations:
Mutations happend spontaneously and continuously during DNA transcription for [[Meiosis]] and [[Mitosis]], mistakes can be made.

But there are certain factors which can affect the rate at which they occur:
- Gamma Rays, x - rays and ultraviolet rays - all types of ionising radiation [[Dangers Of Electromagnetic Waves]]
- Certain types of chemicals - for example tar and tabasco.
These increased rates of mutation can increase the chance of **cancer** occurring.
