## Definition:
Selective breeding, also called artificial seleciton, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new *variaties* of various species.

This is done to select for exaggerate desired traits.

## Characteristics Usually Chosen:
The characteristic can be chosen for usefulness or appearance:
• Disease resistance in food crops.
• Animals which produce more meat or milk.
• Domestic dogs with a gentle nature.
• Large or unusual flowers.

## Steps taken in Selective Breeding:
4 simple steps are taken in the selective breeding process.
1. Decide which characteristics are desirable.
2. Choose parents from a mixed populations that show these characteristics. They are bred together (sexual reproduction).
3. From the offspring those with the desired characterisitcs are bred together.
4. This continues over many generations until all the offspring show the desired characteristic.

## Examples of Selective Breeding:
All of them are varaieties of the same species.

### Corn:

Developed into corn with large seed cobs.

### Brassica
