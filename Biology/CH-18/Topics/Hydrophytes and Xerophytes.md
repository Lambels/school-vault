# Hydrophytes:
Hydrophytes are plants which are adapted to live in extremely wet conditions.

### Common Adaptations:
- Large air spaces in their leaves - keep them close to the surface of the water where there is more photosynthesis.
- Small roots - they can extract water through tissues.
- Stomata open all the time (why not) - they can exchange gases much easier without worrying that they lose water (there is plenty).

# Xerophytes:
Xerophytes are adapted to live in extremely wet conditions.

### Common Adaptations:
- Thick waxy cuticle - prevent as much water from evaporating, also reflect heat and sunlight.
- Sunken stomata - sunken in the epidermis for longer diffusion areas hence less water vapour being lost.
- Leafs rolled - with stomata rolled on the inside of the lead and the inner surface covered with hairs -> traps most air and prevents it from moving -> less transpiration.
- Small leaves - smaller sa -> less [[Evaporation]].
- Extensive shallow roots - quick absorption of allot of water when it rains.
- Thickened leaves or roots - contain water.
