- Roles which interact in the food chain/webs:
	- Producers: They produce their own energy via processes like [[Photosynthesis]]. These are mostly plants.
	- Herbivore: An animal that gets its energy by eating plants.
	- Carnivore: An animal that gets its energy by eating other animals.
	- Primary Consumer: Herbivores (eat producers)
	- Secondary Consumer: Predators that feed on herbivores.
	- Tertiary Consumers: Predators that feed on the secondary consumers.
	- Decomposers: Bacteria and Fungi that feed on decaying organisms and undigested waste.

## Food Chains:
- Shows the transfer of energy from one organism to the next, starting with the producer.
- The source of all the energy comes from the sun, so that is assumed.
- The arrows in the food show the direction of energy transfer from trophic level to trophic level.
- As you move up the trophic levels the available energy decreases.
- An example:
	- grass -> mouse -> owl
	- This food chain has 3 trophic levels.

## Food Webs:
- Inter connected food chains form a network of food chains ie: food webs.
- Food webs are more realistic the food chains since rarely a animal relies on only one other animal.
- They also show connections between the animals in an ecosystem, this is called inter-dependance:

	- if the earthworm population decreases:
		- grass pop. increases.
		- mouse pop. decreases.
		- hawk pop. decreases slightly.
