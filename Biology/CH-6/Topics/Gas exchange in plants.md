- All organisms preform [[Cellular Respiration]] all the time since there is always need of energy to preform life processes.
	- This process gives out carbon dioxide.
- Plants also do [[Photosynthesis]] which makes glucose.
	- This process gives out oxygen.
	- It is mainly affected by the limiting factor ([[Investigating the rate of Photosynthesis]]) **light intensity.**

- You can identify the level of carbon dioxide by measuring the pH (carbon dioxide is acidic):
