- Green plants preform photosynthesis to make the carbohydrate glucose out of raw materials oxygen and water.
- They use a green pigment called [[Chlorophyll]] to capture the energy needed for the reaction from the sun.
- Oxygen gas is released as a waste gas.

$$
\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O ->[chlorophyll][sunlight] C6H12O6 + 6O2}
$$
- Where:
	- $\ce{C6H12O6}$ is glucose.
		- Used in [[Respiration]].
		- Build structures used by the plant.
		- Turned in sucrose for transportation.
	- $\ce{O2}$ or is oxygen.
		- Used in [[Respiration]].
		- Released out of the leaf through the stomata.
	- $\ce{CO2}$ is carbon dioxide.
		- Diffuses in the leaf via the stomata.
	- $\ce{H2O}$ is water.
		- Goes in via the [[Xylem]].
