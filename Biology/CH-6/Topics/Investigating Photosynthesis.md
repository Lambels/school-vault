## Iodine Test:
- When Iodine is added to starch it turns from **brown -> black / blue**.
- Iodine or potassium iodine can be used to preform the test.

### Iodine test on leafs:
1. De-starch the plant.
	- By leaving the plant in a dark room for 24 hours, no more starch will be made since there is no photosynthesis.
	- The plant will use up its stored starch.
	- After 24 hours no starch will be left in the plant.
2. Remove a leaf from the plant.
3. Put the leaf in boiling water to kill the cells and break down the cell membrane.
4. Place the leaf in a tube of boiling ethanol heated by boiling water.
	- Removes the [[Chlorophyll]] from the leaf.
	- Remove from the tube when the leaf becomes brownish.
5. Wash the leaf with cold water.
6. Add droplets of Iodine.

## Correlations in [[Photosynthesis]]:
- We know that [[Photosynthesis]] produces glucose.
- We also know that glucose is converted to starch for storage. ([[Uses of Carbohydrates]])
- We can use the Iodine Test to prove that photosynthesis produces starch.
- We can also use it to test for the factors which play in [[Photosynthesis]].

### Light:
- Cover part of the de-starched leaf with something which will block light.
- Place the leaf in sunlight.
- Preform the iodine test on the leaf.
- The part which had access to sunlight will color black/blue and the covered part (didnt get access to sunlight) will be brown.
	- This means sunlight is needed for [[Photosynthesis]].

### [[Chlorophyll]]:
- Will use a variegated leaf.
- Has areas where the leaf is green ([[Chlorophyll]] present) and white ([[Chlorophyll]] absent).
- Place the leaf in sunlight.
- Preform iodine test on the leaf.
- Green areas will now be black/blue and white areas will now be brown.
	- This means [[Chlorophyll]] is needed for [[Photosynthesis]].

### Carbon Dioxide:
- Prepare two jars.
	- In one jar add potassium hydroxide, this will react with the carbon dioxide and remove it from the air.
	- In the other jar burn a candle, this will not only remove from the oxygen in the air but also add carbon dioxide in the air.
- Place de-starched plants in the jars and leave them in the sunlight.
- Preform iodine test on a leaf from each plant.
- The leaf with little carbon dioxide will be brown.
	- This means carbon dioxide is needed for [[Photosynthesis]].
