## Measuring the rate:
- ![[Pasted image 20221220190813.png]]
- Rate can be identified by:
	- **number of oxygen bubbles / min**
	- **measuring the volume of oxygen produced over a long period**


## Investigating multiple limiting factors:
- A **limiting factor** is a factor in the environment that is limiting the rate of a reaction.
- These include:
	- Carbon dioxide concentration.
	- Light intensity.
	- Temperature.
- The more one of a factor is present the less it becomes a limiting factor.


### Carbon Dioxide:

- When the graph is levelled off something else is *limiting* the rate.
- This can be observed by playing with the concentration of sodium hydrogen carbonate added to the pond weed.

###  Light Intensity:
- ![[Pasted image 20221220191926.png]]
- Generally the more light is supplied to a plant the faster it will photosynthesise.
- This trend will occur until the graph flatlines and another factor is limiting the process.

- Cam be investigated by moving a lamp further or closer away from the setup.

### Temperature:
- ![[Pasted image 20221220192116.png]]
- As temperature increases so does the rate of photosynthesis.
- This is because the reaction is controlled by [[Enzymes]], although the enzyme can denature if the optimum temperature is surpassed.

- This can be investigating by heating the water.

## Glass Houses:
- Glass houses provide artificial environments to mimic the optimal conditions.
- They do so by:
	- Using **artificial lighting** to control the light intensity.
	- Enriching the atmosphere with carbon dioxide by **burning coal or oil**.
	- Using a **heating system** to increase the optimum temperature.
		- **Ventilation** may be required since hot air might have to be released so that the enzymes dont denature.
