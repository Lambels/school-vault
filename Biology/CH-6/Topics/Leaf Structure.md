- The layers go like this:
	- Upper epidermis:
		- Waxy Cuticle.
		- Epidermis cells.
	- Mesophyll layer:
		- Palisade Mesophyll layer.
		- Spongy Mesophyll layer.
		- Vascular Bundle:
			- [[Xylem]]
			- [[Phloem]]
	- Lower epidermis:
		- Epidermis cells.
		- Guard cells.
		- Stomata.

## Palisade Mesophyll cells:
- Contain most of chloroplasts. ([[Chlorophyll]])
- Site of [[Photosynthesis]].
- Give the color of the leaf.

## Adaptations for [[Photosynthesis]]:
- **Waxy Cuticle**:
	- Usually on the top of the leaf.
	- Usually thin. ([[Hydrophytes and Xerophytes]])
	- Prevents water from [[Evaporation]] out of the epidermis.
	- Helps plant stop from drying out.
- **Upper Epidermis**:
	- They are transparent.
	- Thin.
	- They allow light to pass in through.
- **Palisade Mesophyll**:
	- Most chloroplasts.
	- Packet together towards the top of the leaf.
- **Spongy Mesophyll**:
	- Air spaces.
	- Large internal SA to volume ratio.
	- Allows efficient diffusion of carbon dioxide.
- **Many Pores / Stomata**:
	- Allows the movement of gasses in and out of the leaf.
- **Vascular Bundle**:
	- Vast network of veins.
	- [[Xylem]]:
		- Supplies the water needed for photosynthesis.
	- [[Phloem]]:
		- Carries out sucrose.
- **Leaf**:
	- Large SA. (Hit more light)
	- Thin. (Allows more carbon dioxide to move through the leaf)
