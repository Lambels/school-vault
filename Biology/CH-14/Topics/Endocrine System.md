- The endocrine system has to do with **hormones**:
	- Hormones are protein or steroids which are produced by a gland and are carried by the blood.
	- The hormone alters the activity of one or more specific target organs.
	- These glands all together form the endocrine system.

### How hormones target the target cells:
- When hormones are created they can only be absorbed by cells with the specific hormone receptor.
- Hormone glands have good blood supply so that the hormones can be carried by blood.
- Liver regulates the amount of hormones in blood.

### Important hormones in the human body:

	- produced in the adrenaline gland.
	- prepares body for fight or flight response.
	- increases heart rate and breathing rate.
	- speeds up the breaking down of glycogen.
	- directs blood flow to the muscles.
	- dilates pupil.
- Insulin:
	- produced in the liver.
	- causes excess glucose in the blood to be taken into cells and stored as glycogen.
- Testosterone:
	- produced in testes.
	- causes the development of second male sexual characteristics.
- Oestrogen:
	- produced in ovaries.
