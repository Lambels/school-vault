## Structures:
- Fovea:
	- Area in the eye where light is concentrated.
	- Contains most of the cone cells. (these are sensitive to colour and there are 3 types (RED, GREEN, BLUE) )
- Retina:
	- Contains light receptor cells scattered around.
		- Cones - detect colour.
		- Rods - detect light intensity.
- Cornea:
	- Transparent lens which refracts light as it enters the eye.
- Iris:
	- Controls the dilation of the pupil and how much light enters the pupil.
- Lens:
	- Transparent disc which can change shape and thickness to concentrate light onto the fovea or retina.
- Optic Nerve:
	- Creates a blind spot.
		- Brain fills in this blind spot.
		- Cant see if something is there in our peripheral vision.
	- Sensory [[Neurones]] which carries impulses between the eye and the central nervous system.
- Pupil:
	- A hole that allows light to enter the eye.

## The pupil reflex and accommodation:

### Pupil Reflex:
- This reflex controls how much light enters the eye via the pupil.

- The radial and circular muscles work antagonistically:
	- The radial muscles contract and circular relax the pupil dilates.

### Accommodation:
- The function on the eye which helps us focus on distant or close objects.
- 3 elements come in play:
	- The lens.
	- Ciliary muscles.
	- Suspensory ligaments.
	- The last 2 work antagonistically.
- When the object is near: lens has to refract more light and becomes more convex:
	- ciliary muscles contract and the ligaments slacken, lets lens become fatter, light refracted more.
- When an object is far: the lens needs to become more concave (thinner):
	- ciliary muscles relax and suspensory ligaments tighten, lens becomes thinner (gets pulled).
