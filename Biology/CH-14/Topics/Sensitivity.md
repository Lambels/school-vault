- Sensitivity is the ability to detect and respond to a change in the environment.
- A change in the environment is called a stimulus.
	- A receptor organ recognises the stimulus.
	- An effector is an organ which carries out the response.
- Two systems involved in the response and detection which lead up to sensitivity:
	- [[Endocrine System]]
	- [[Nervous System]]
