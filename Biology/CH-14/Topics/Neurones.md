- Bundles of neurones form nerves.
- There are 3 types of neurones which are all adapted to their functions:
	- They have many endings.
	- They are called axons and dendrons and connect to other neurones to pass on the electrical signals.

### Sensory Neurones:
- These are a type of neurone.
- They link sense organs to the CNS.

### Relay Neurones:
- These are a type of neurone.
- They operate within the central nervous system.
- They are very short.

### Motor Neurones:
- These are a type of neurone.
- They connect the CNS to an effector:
	- Muscle.

## Synapses:
- Neurones do not directly touch each other.
- When the signal reaches the end of an axon this triggers a release of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which diffuse through the synaptic gap.

1. When the electrical signal reaches the end of an axon it triggers the release of neurotransmitters.
2. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic gap.
3. The neurotransmitters molecules bind to the receptors on the post synaptic neurone. When they bind to the receptor they trigger a electric impulse that passes along the post synaptic neurone.

## Reflex Response:
![[reflex_arc.png]]

- path taken:
	- stimulus -> receptor -> sensory neurone -> relay neurone -> motor neurone -> effector -> response
- Involuntary reactions:
	- the body responds without the conscious decision of the CNS.
	- fast.
- Voluntary reactions:
	- the brain is used to make a conscious decision.
	- slower.
