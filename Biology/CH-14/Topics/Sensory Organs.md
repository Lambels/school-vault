- Sensory organs contain groups of receptors that respond to a specific stimuli.
	- **skin**:
		- sensitive to pressure, heat, temp and pain.
	- **tongue**:
		- sensitive to chemicals in food and drinks.
	- **nose**:
		- sensitive to chemicals in the air.
	- **ear**:
		- sensitive to sound and movement.
	- **[[Eye]]**:
		- sensitive to light.
- once the sense organ has been stimulated it sends an electrical signal which is passed to a sensory [[Neurones]] which carries the signal to the Central [[Nervous System]].
- There, a decision is made for a response.
