- sexual reproduction is a process which involves the fusion of two nuclei from two sex cells (gametes) to form a fertilised egg (zygote).
- results in the production of genetically different offspring.

### Gametes:
- sex cell.
- has half the number of chromosomes from a normal cell (haploid, normal is diploid.)
	- they contain only one copy of each chromosome.
- fuse to make zygote - diploid.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Sexual Reproduction:
- advantages:
	- increased genetic variation.
	- species can adapt to new environments due to [[Variation]].
	- disease is less likely to affect a population.
- disadvantages:
	- takes time and energy to find mates.
	- difficult for isolated members.
	- can lead to unsuccessful offspring.
