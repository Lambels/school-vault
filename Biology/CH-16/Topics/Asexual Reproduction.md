## Advantages and Disadvantages of Asexual Reproduction:
- advantages:
	- Population can be increased rapidly when the conditions are right.
	- Can exploit suitable environments quickly.
	- More time and energy efficient.
- disadvantages:
	- Limited genetic variation.
	- Population limited to one habitat, any change can be proved devastator.
	- Diseases can easily wipe a whole population since there is no genetic [[Variation]].
