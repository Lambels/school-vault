## What is a polymer?
- A polymer is any substance containing very large molecules, formed when allot of small molecules join together.
- For example, the polymerisation of ethene (an alkene [[17.6]]):

	- The product is called a **polymer**.
	- The **polymer** formed is called **poly(ethene)** or **polythene.**
	- The reaction is called **polymerisation**.
- **In a polymerisation reaction, thousands of small molecules join together to make one big molecule. The small molecules are called monomers. The product is called a polymer.**

## Synthetic polymers:
- Polythene is an example of a synthetic polymer.
- Synthetic means made in a lab.
- They include:
	- polythene.
	- nylon.
	- lycra.
	- chewing gum.
	- water-soluble polymers in hair gels.

## Natural polymers:
- Main monomer is glucose, it makes:
	- Starch, found in: rice, bread and potatoes.
	- Cellulose, found in: cotton (we wear almost pure cellulose.)
- Also amino acids are very common monomers which make wide spread proteins:
	- Collagen.
	- Keratin.
	- Proteins (etc).

## Reactions that produce polymers:
- Not all polymers are formed the same way.
	- **Addition polymerisation** (Addition reactions [[17.6]]).
	- **Condensation polymerisation**.
