## Addition polymerisation (An addition reaction):
- C=C double bond required (unsaturated molecule).
- The polymerisation forms via an addition reaction. [[17.6]]
	- Therefor its called **addition polymerisation**.
- In addition polymerisation, double bonds in molecules break, and the molecules add on to each other.
- The formed polymers all have a c-c-c backbone from the addition reaction taking place.

## The Monomer:
- Small molecules which make up the polymer are called monomers.
- For addition polymerisation to take place, the monomers must have C=C double bonds.

### Co Polymers:
- A polymer derived from more then one species of monomers.
- The polymerisation of monomers into copolymers is called copolymerisation.
- They dont have a specific formula since the monomer chain doesnt follow any sequence.

## Chain lengths:
- The chains making the polymer can be of different lengths even if they are the same polymer.
- The chains arent all of the same length, thats why we cant write and exact formula.

### Chain lengths in Polythene:
- In polythene all molecules have long chains of carbon with hydrogen atoms attached to them.
- They are all similar molecules, bot not the same. They most have different chain lengths hence no exact formula.
- By altering the reaction conditions we can get an average chain length to be higher or lower, but the chains will never be the same length.
- The relative mass ($M_r$) of an ethene molecule is 28. But the $M_r$ of the polymer molecules of polythene can be 500,000 or more, thats about 17,000 molecules.
