## Condensation polymerisation differences (from [[18.2]]):
- Cannot form co polymers.
- Two functional groups needed on each monomer.
- C=C double bond not needed:
	- Doesnt depend on addition reaction [[17.6]] but on condensation reactions [[17.8]].
- They get rid of a smaller molecule to make space for the new bond.

## 1. Nylon:
- Nylon is made using 2 monomers which both have active groups on their ends:
	- ![[18 - page 5.png]]
- The two monomers react and join forming nylon and HCl hence the condensation reaction, the two bigger molecules combine and give out the smaller molecule HCl.
	- ![[18 - page 6.png]]
- The reaction continues on both ends of the product and many large chains joined by the amide linkage form.
	- Polymers formed with this linkage are named polyamides and have the same linkage as proteins ([[Protein Synthesis]]).

## 2. Terylene:
- Similarly to nilon, terylene is made using 2 monomers which have active groups on both sides.
	- ![[18 - page 7.png]]
- The two monomers reacts producing a bigger molecule (the polymer) and driving out water.
	- ![[18 - page 8.png]]
- The continues on both sides (I made a mistake, there needs to be a carbon bond on the right hand side), till long chains joined by ester bonds form ([[17.8]]).
	- Polymers with ester linkages are called polyesters and make up allot of our clothes since it doesnt crease easily and are more hard wearing.
