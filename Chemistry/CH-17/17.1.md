## The fossil fuels:
- Petroleum
- Coal
- Natural Gas
- They are all the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.

## Petroleum:
- Mixture of mainly different hydrocarbons and organic compounds.
- Most hydrocarbons only contain hydrogen and carbon:
	- Pentane: ![[chain molecule (alkane).png]]
		- Straight chain.
	- Cyclohexane: ![[cyclic molecule (alkane).png]]
		- Ring (cyclic) chain.
	- 3-Methyl pentane: ![[branched molecule (alkane).png]]
		- Branched chain.
- Carbons are bonded to each other to make a spine, whilst hydrogens are binded to the carbon spine.

## How we use petroleum:
- Used in transport as fuel.
- Burned for heat to turn water to steam -> spin turbines.
- Starting chemical in plastics, soaps, paint and more.
