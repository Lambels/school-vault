## The Alkanes:
- Simplest family of organic compounds.
- Hydrocarbons.
- They all have C-C single bonds so they are saturated.
- They form a homologous series with the formula: $\ce{\textbf{C}_{n}\textbf{H}_{2n+2} }$
- ![[Alkanes.png]]
- These are the first 3 alkanes.

### Properties:
1. They are found in petroleum and natural gas. Natural gas only has the first 4: (which are gaseous) Methane, Ethane, Propane and Butane. Petroleum has allot more, up to $n=70$
2. The first 4 are gases at rtp, the rest are solids. Boiling points increase as you move up the chain length since the attraction forces between the molecules increases.
3. Since they have C-C bonds, they are called **saturated**.
4. Generally alkanes are quite unreactive due to their C-C bonds.
5. Alkanes do burn well in good supply of oxygen:
$$
\ce{CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)}
$$
6. If there is incomplete combustion: (CO formed)
$$
\ce{CH4 (g) + 3O2 (g) -> 2CO (g) + 4H2O (l)}
$$
7. Alkanes also react with chlorine in sunlight:
$$
\ce{CH4 + Cl2 ->[light] CH3Cl + HCl}
$$
	The reaction is called a substitution reaction because a chlorine atom takes the place of a hydrogen atom. If there is enough chlorine, all four hydrogen atoms will be replaced one by one. $\ce{CCl4}$ is the final product (tetrachloromethane).
	The reaction is a photochemical reaction since it needs light to occur, light energy is needed to break the bonds of the chlorine molecules and start the reaction off.

## Isomers:
- Molecules with the same formula but different structure.
- Some can be branched, while some can be chained.
- The more carbon atoms in a compound, the more isomers it can form.
- Branched isomers have lower boiling points since the molecules are further apart.
- They also burn less easily.

### Isomers of dichloroethane:

- ![[Pasted image 20221207112805.png]]
- These are the only isomers of dichloroethane, the 2 chlorine have to either be placed both on one carbon atom (doesnt mater where) or one chlorine on one carbon and the other on the other one.
