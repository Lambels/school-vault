## The Alkenes:
- Hydrocarbons.
- They all contain C=C double bond. This is their functional group and mostly dictates how they react.
- They are unsaturated since they have a C=C bond.
- They form a homologous series in the form $\ce{\textbf{C}_{n}\textbf{H}_{2n}}$
- ![[Alkenes.png]]
- These are the first 3 alkenes. (methene doesnt exist since we need the double bond.)

### Properties:
1. The alkenes are made by cracking alkanes ([[17.5]]).
$$
\ce{C2H6 ->[steam>800^{\circ}C]C2H4 + H2}
$$
	Note that ethene and hydrogen are formed from ethane.

2. Alkenes are much more reactive then alkanes. This happens because of their C=C double bond, this bond can break and add on to other atoms.
	For example you can add hydrogen to ethene to form ethane:
	
	This reaction can be used to change the vegetable oil (containing double bonds) to margarine (containing single bonds).
$$
\ce{C2H4 + H2 ->[heat, pressure][catalyst] C2H6}
$$
	It also adds on water (steam) to form an alcohol.
$$
\ce{C2H4 (g) + H2O (g) <=>[heat, pressure][catalyst] C2H5OH}
$$
	Notice that ethanol (an alcohol ([[17.7]])) is formed.
	**All these reactions are called addition reactions because it turned the unsaturated alkene into a saturated compound.**

3. **Polymerisation**:
	-  The alkenes also undergo a very useful addition reaction, they add on to each other to form compounds with very long carbon chains.
	- ![[polymerisation of ethene.png]]
		- The addition reaction of ethene with ethene.
		- **Ends of the chain needs to be open.**
	- The alkene molecules (ethene) are called monomers (they make up a polymer chain).
	- The long chain formed is called a polymer and the reaction is called polymerisation.
	- The product is called poly(ethene) or polythene.

## Test for unsaturation:
- As we discussed earlier, alkenes are unsaturated and can preform addition reactions.
- To test wether a compound is saturated or not we can use the **Bromine Water Test**.
- ![[saturation test (bromine water).png]]
- Since the alkene can accommodate the bromine and form a colourless compound (colour -> colourless).
$$
\ce{C2H4 + Br2(orange) -> C2H4Br2(colourless)}
$$

## Isomers:
- Double bonds can be in different positions and the molecule can branch of in different ways.
- Isomers of $\ce{C4H8}$:
