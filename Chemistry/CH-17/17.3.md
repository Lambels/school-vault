## What is cracking?
- After refining petroleum, the fractions still need more separating before they are used.
	- They contain sulfur impurities, if burned they will form sulfur dioxide gas.
	- Some fractions are broken down into further single compounds, for example the gas fraction gets broken down into methane, propane, butane, ethane.
- Cracking means breaking down molecules into smaller ones.

| Properties   | Reactant                | Product                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Appearance   | Thick colourless liquid | Colourless gas          |
| Smell        | No smell                | Pungent smell           |
| Flammability | Difficult to burn       | Burns easily            |
| Reactions    | Few chemical reactions  | Many chemical reactions |

- Process carried out by thermal decomposition.
- Since the reactant was not flammable and had a high boiling point, it mustve had long carbon chains.
- The product now has a low boiling point and is flammable, the products long carbon chain mustve been broken into smaller carbon chains.

## Cracking in the refinery:
1. The long chain of hydrocarbon is heated to vaporise it.
2. The vapour is usually passed over a hot catalyst.
3. Thermal decomposition takes place.

## Why is cracking important?
- Cracking helps you make the best use of petroleum. Suppose you have to much of the naphtha fraction and too little of the gasoline fraction. You can crack some naphtha to get molecules of the right size for petrol.
- Cracking *always* produces short chain compounds with carbon=carbon double bond. This makes the compounds reactive. Now they can be used as starting points in other chemicals like plastics.

## Examples of cracking:
- Cracking the naphtha fraction. *this fraction is often cracked since its used as the feedstock for many useful chemicals*
$$
\ce{C10H22 ->[ 500^{\circ}C, catalyst ] C5H12 + C3H6 + C2H4}
$$
*the breaking down of decane -> pentane, propane, ethene*

- Cracking ethane.
$$
\ce{C2H6 ->[ steam > 800^{\circ}C ] C2H4 + H2}
$$
*The hydrogen made can be used in making ammonia via the Haber process. ([[16.2]])*
