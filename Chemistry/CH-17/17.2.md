## What is refining?
- Petroleum or oil contains hundreds of different hydrocarbons but when mixed together they arent of grate use.
- The first step in making use of petroleum is refining it:
	- Separate compounds into groups of similar sizes.
	- Carried out by fractional distillation.

## Refining in the lab:

1. Heat up the petroleum, the compounds start to evaporate (the smallest first - break of easiest from the bonds in the liquid).
2. The hot vapour rises through the test tube, as it does so the reading on the thermometer also rises.
3. The hot vapour condenses on the cold delivery tube, it now drips in the collection tube.
4. When the thermometer reads 100 deg C you have obtained your first fraction from the distillation. Replace the collection tube with a new one.
5. Repeat the process to obtain the rest of the fractions for 150, 200, 300 deg C.

### Comparing these fractions:
- Fraction 1:
	- Burns very easily
	- Volatile
	- Very runny
	- Small molecules
- Fraction 2:
	- Burns easily
	- Less volatile
	- Runny
	- Bigger molecules
- Fraction 3:
	- Burns not easily
	- Even less volatile
	- Not very runny
	- Bigger molecules
- Fraction 4:
	- Only with a wick
	- Least volatile
	- Viscous
	- Largest molecules

## In a petroleum refinery:

- Refinery Gas -> bottled gas for cooking.
- Gasoline/Petrol -> Fuel for cars.
- Naphtha -> Feedstock for many chemicals and plastics.
- Paraffin/Kerosine -> Fuel for aircraft / stoves.
- Diesel Oil -> Fuel for diesel engines.
- Fuel Oil -> Fuel for power station / ships.
- Lubricating Fraction -> Oil for car engines and machinery; waxes and polishes.
- Bitumen -> for road surfaces and roofs.
