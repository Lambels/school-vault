## The Carboxylic Acids:
- They all contain the **COOH** group (carboxyl group).
- They form a homologous series $\ce{\textbf{C}_{n}\textbf{H}_{2n}\textbf{O}_2}$
- Their functional group is the **COOH** carboxyl group.
	- ![[carboxyl group.png]]

- These are the first 3 acids.

## How to make ethanoic acid:
- Ethanoic acid is made by oxidising ethanol.
$$
\ce{C2H5OH + [O] -> CH3COOH}
$$

### 1. Oxydising biologically:
- When ethanol is left standing in air, bacteria bring about its oxidation to ethanoic acid.
- This is called acid fermentation (preformed by bacteria).
	- Heat favours these bacteria.
$$
\ce{C2H5OH + O2 -> CH3COOH + H2O}
$$
- This fermentation is used to make vinegar (dilute solution of ethanoic acid). Foods ferment to give ethanol (or already have it present) -> acid fermentation -> ethanoic acid.

### 2. Oxidising chemically:
- Strong oxidising agent can be used potassium manganate(VII) or potassium dichromate.
- The $\ce{Mn^7+}$ ions get reduced to $\ce{Mn^2+}$ ions with a colour change. During this reduction it oxidises the ethanol is oxidised (loses electrons to the manganate ions).
$$
\ce{MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- -> Mn^2+ + 4H2O}
$$
- These $\ce{5e-}$ are taken from the ethanol to oxidise it to ethanoic acid.

## Ethanoic acid: typical reactions:
1. Solution of ethanoic acid in water turns litmus paper red.
2. It also reacts with metals, bases and carbonates to form salts. (see [[11.3]])
$$
\ce{CH3COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> CH2COONa(aq) + H2O(l)}
$$
$$
\ce{CH3COO-(aq) + H+(aq) + Na+(aq) + OH- (aq)}
$$
*ethanoate ion*
	The ethanoic acid is weak since only some molecules dissociate  (not high concentration of protons).
	This can be observed from the equation below where there is an equilibrium between the dissociated ions and the carboxylic acid molecule. 
$$
\ce{CH3COOH <=> CH3COO- + H+}
$$

## Esters:
-  Esters are compounds formed after the reaction between carboxylic acids and alcohols.
- Two molecules join together with the lost of a small molecule, water. This is called a **condensation reaction**.
	- When the water forms, two valences remain open, they bond where the valences are unsatisfied to make stable electron configuration.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230103114704.png]]
- They also have attractive smells and taste good. (added to shampoos and soaps + artificial flavouring)
	- ![[ester.png]]
	- Reaction between ethanoic acid and propanol: it yields propyl ethanoate:
$$
\ce{CH3COOH(l) + C3H7OH <=>[conc H2SO4] CH3COOC3H7(l) + H2O(l)}
$$

### Naming esters:
- We will name this ester:
	- ![[ester name.png]]
- The first part of the name indicates the number of carbon atoms in the chain of the alcohol and ends with '- yl'. Note that the alcohol comes first in the name but last in the molecule.
	- eth + yl = ethyl
- The second part of the name indicates the length of the chain of carbon in the acid part (first in molecule) and ends with '- oate'.
	- butan + oate = butanoate
- ethyl + butanoate = ethyl butanoate (an ester).
