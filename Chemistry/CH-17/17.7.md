## The Alcohols:
- They all contain **OH** group.
- They form a homologous series $\ce{\textbf{C}_{n}\textbf{H}_{2n+1}\textbf{OH}}$
- Their functional group is the **OH** group. This means they will all react similarly.

- These are the first 3 alcohols.

## Ethanol, an important alcohol:
- Ethanol is a good solvent.
- Ethanol is volatile, makes it good for glue, printing inks, perfumes and aftershaves (dry quickly).
- Burns readily is oxygen, gives of allot of heat and energy.

## Two ways to make ethanol:

### 1. By Fermentation:
- During anaerobic respiration of yeast (fermentation), ethanol is produced.
- The enzymes in yeast catalyse this reaction.
$$
\ce{C6H12O6 ->[enzymes][in yeast] 2C2H5OH + 2CO2 + energy}
$$
- You can start with anything that contains sugars, starch or cellulose since they are all polymers of the monomer glucose (they all break down to glucose).
- The yeast stops working when the % of ethanol reaches a certain level or the mixture gets too hot (the process is exothermic).
- The ethanol is separated from the final mixture by fractional distillation.

### 2. By Hydration of ethene:
- Hydration means water added on. (this is an addition reaction)
$$
\ce{C2H4(g) + H2O(g) <=>[570^{\circ}C, 60-70 atm][phosphoric acid] C2H5OH(l)}
$$
- Forward exothermic.
- High pressure and low temperature give the best yield. Usually carried at $570^{\circ}C$, to give a decent rate.
- Catalyst also used to speed up the reaction.

### Comparing the 2 methods:
- Fermentation:
	- Pro:
		- It uses renewable resources (plants).
		- You can use waste plant material.
	- Con:
		- You need allot of plant material for a litre of ethanol. (allot of land needs to be allocated for plant growth.)
		- Fermentation is slow - you need to start all over again for each batch of new material.
		- The yeast stops working after % of ethanol reached even if glucose is still left.
		- You need heat for fractional distillation.
- Hydration:
	- Pro:
		- Fast.
		- Can be ran continuously (just keep removing the ethanol)
		- Gives pure ethanol.
	- Con:
		- Ethene is made from oil, non renewable.
		- Great deal of heat needed, expensive.
		- Reversible reaction, yield not high -> need to recycle unreacted ethene and steam.

## Ethanol as fuel:
- Ethanol burns well in oxygen:
$$
\ce{C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) + heat}
$$
- Good because:
	- It can be made quite cheaply from waste plant material.
	- Some countries dont have access to petroleum.
	- Help fight against global warming since the plants grown to make ethanol consume the carbon dioxide produced.
