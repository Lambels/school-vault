## What their names tell you:
1. How many carbon atoms are in it.
	1. meth-  -> 1
	2. eth-  -> 2
	3. prop-  -> 3
	4. but-  -> 4
	5. pent-  -> 5
	6. hex-  -> 6
2. To which family it belongs:
	1. -ane -> The Alkanes - [[17.5]]
	2. -ene -> The Alkenes - [[17.6]]
	3. -ol -> The Alcohols - [[17.7]]
	4. -oic acid -> The Carboxylic Acids - [[17.8]]

## The Alkanes: Simplest Family
![[Alkanes.png]]
- As you move to the right the boiling point increases with the chain length.
- They only have single bonds.

## The Alkenes:
![[Alkenes.png]]
- They contain carbon=carbon double bonds.
- The C=C bond is their functional group.

## The Alcohols:
![[Alcohols.png]]
- Similar to alkanes but with an OH group.
- The OH group is their functional group.

## The Carboxylic Acids:
![[Carboxylic Acids.png]]
- All have an COOH group.
- The COOH group is their functional group.

## Functional groups:
- A functional group is the part of the molecule which will largely dictate how the molecule will react.
- For example all the alkanes have similar reactions due to the C=C bond.

## Homologous series:
- Series which forms a general formula for a family of molecules.
- As the chain gets longer:
	- Melting and boiling point increases.
	- Viscosity increases.
	- Flammability decreases.
