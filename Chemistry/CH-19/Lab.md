## Independent variables:
- The ones that change during the experiment.

## Dependant variables:
- The ones you read.

## Note:
- If you have other variables those need to stay unchanged.

### Example:
- Measuring how rate of a reaction changes with temp.
	- Independent var = temperature.
	- dependant var = rate of reaction.
