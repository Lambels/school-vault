## What is Air?
Air is around us and is made up of multiple gases:

Composition of air (clean and dry):
- **Nitrogen** - 78%
- **Oxygen** - 21%
- Other - About 1% (Carbon Dioxide, Argon, Xenon, Neon...)

- Air which isnt clean and dry can also contain water vapour, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide.

## Oxygen:
Both plants and animals depend on oxygen for **respiration**.

> glucose + oxygen -> CO2 + H20 + **ENERGY**

### Measuring The % Of Oxygen In The Air:
![[amount-oxygen-in-air.gif]]
- Push the gas from syringe to syringe passing the gas through the heated copper repetidely. Whilst doing this the oxygen in the circulated air will pass through the heated copper reacting with it to form copper oxide (solid).

- When the quantity of air doesent change when recycling the air calculate the percentage difference.
