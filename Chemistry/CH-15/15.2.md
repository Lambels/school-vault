## Separating The Gasses From The Air:
Method used: **Fractional Distillation**

![[fractional distillation(1).jpg]]

Steps taken:
1. Air is filtered to remove dust particles.
2. Water vapour, carbon dioxide and other pollutants are removed since they have a low freezing point and would block the pipes.
3. The air is now **compressed** -> making the air **hot**. It is cooled down by recycling cold air.
4. The cold, compressed air is passed into a larger space. It **expands** rapidly making it **very cold**
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the air reaches approximately -200 deg C .
6. The liquid air is pumped into the fractionating column where it is slowly warmed up and separated.

### Gases Received:
Through Fractional Distillation:
- Nitrogen
- Argon
- Oxygen
- Krypton
- Xenon

By Getting Absorbed On Charcoal (Lowest BPs):
- Helium
- Neon

## Uses Of Oxygen:
- Oxygen Masks
- Oxygen Tents
- Making Steels (steel furnace ([[14.3]]))
- Oxy-Acetylene Torch

## Uses Of Nitrogen:
- Freeze food, liquids in cracked pipes, store tissue samples. *it gets very cold*
- Flushed through food packaging to remove oxygen and keep food fresh. *it is un reactive*

## Noble Gases:
*present in atmosphere*

### Argon:
- Inert atmosphere in tungsten light bulbs (oxygen would corrode the tungsten)

### Neon:
- advertising signs (glows red when current passes through it)

### Helium:
- fill balloons (low density)
