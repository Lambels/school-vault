## What is rusting?
**Corrosion** is the breaking down by reacting with something in the atmosphere.
For iron corrosion means **rusting**.
> 4Fe + 3O2 + 4H2O -> **2Fe2O3 x 2H2O**

Whats on the right hand side of the ecuation is rust and its **red-brown**.

## Investigate Rusting:
The condition for rusting to occur are air + water.

Tube A:
- Air + Water -> Rust

Tube B:
- Water -> Nothing

Tube C:
- Dry Air -> Nothing

## Prevent Rusting:
2 main ways:

### Mechanical:
- Cover with paint
- Cover with grease
- Cover with another metal (galvanising ([[13.5]]) or electroplating ([[8.5]]) )

### Chemical:
- Sacrificial Protection ([[13.5]])
