## Fossil Fuels:
Fossil fuels, more specifically hydrocarbons, when burnt produce toxic gases (these are the main air pollutants):

| Pollutant | How It Forms | What Harm It Does |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nitrogen Oxides - NO, NO2 | Nitrogen and Oxygen bind under high temperatures | Cause respiratory problems, acid rain and photochemical smog |
| Carbond Dioxide - CO2 | Burning hydrocarbons | Global Warming |
| Methane - CH4 | Animal excretions | Global warming (most efficient) |
| Lead Compounds | Compound of lead added to petrol to help it burn smoothly | Lead damages childrens brains and also damages kidneys and nervous sytsem |
| Carbon Monoxide - CO | When the carbon compounds in the fossil fuels brun in a limited supply of oxygen | Binds to haemoglobin and prevents the intake of oxygen |
| Sulfur Dioxide - SO2 | When sulfur compounds in fossil fuels burn | Acidic Oxide - Damages eyes or dissolves in water to form acid rain |

### Particulate:
- Soot from diesel engines which gets into the lungs and doesnt come out. Causes respiratory problems and lung cancer.

## Reducing Air Pollution:
1. **Desulfurisation** (removal of SO2 from waste gases) - by using *basic* filters (calcium hydroxide or calcium oxide) on the furnaces in power stations. *the SO2 gets neutralised by the basic character of the filters* 
2. Ban **Lead** in petrol.
3. Planting trees, reducing livestock farming.
4. Use hydrogen and renewable energy (wind, solar).
5. Use catalytic converters on cars exhausts.

## Catalystic Converters:

### What comes in:
- Nitrogen Oxydes
- Carbon Monoxide
- Unburnt Hydrocarbons

### What goes out:
- Nitrogen
- Water
- Carbon Dioxide

> First Reaction: 2NO -> N2 (g) + O2 (g) (harmless gases)

Oxygen obtained from former reaction is used in:
> O2 (g) + 2CO(g) -> 2CO2 (g) (relatively harmless gass)

> Hydrocarbons (CxHy) -> CO2 + H2O

## Greenhouse gases - Climate Change:
Greenhouse gases cause **climate change**.
Like everything in life **climate change** has consequences:
- Dry places become drier - wildfires
- Wet places become wetter - flooding, storms
- Melting of ice caps at the poles - flooding
- Glaciers shrink - less water for rivers

All these lead to:
- Less crops
- Human Migration
- Species extintion -> Less variaty
- More diseases and harmful insects (moisture)

## Combating Climate Change:

### Non carbon electricity:
- wind, waves, fast flowing water - hydroelectricity
- nuclear power
- solar power - PV cells

### Non carbon power for transport:
- batteries
- hydrogen - oxygen fuel cells

### Reduce deforestation, plant trees:
- CO2 is taken in - photosyntest
> 6CO2 (g) + 6H20 (l) -> (light, chlorophyll) C6H12O6 (s) + 6O2 (g)

### Reduce methane emissions:
- rear grazing livestock
