## Extraction Of Aluminium:
- before the extraction, bauxite is processed into alumina (aluminium oxide)
- alumina is then electrolysed.

### The Electrolysis of Aluminium:
![[electrolysis_alu.png]]

### The electrolyte - cryolite:
- sodium aluminium floride.
- decreases the melting point of alumina.
- increases the conductivity in the electrolysis tank.

### The reactions in the tank:
- Once the alumina is dissolved in the cryolite the aluminium and oxide ions are free to move .
- At the cathode:
	- The aluminium ions gain electrons (are reduced), it the drops as molten metal.
	- 4Al3 (l) + 12e- -> 4Al (l)
	- Used to run into molds.
	- Mixed with other metals to form alloys.
- At the anode:
	- The oxygen ions lose electrons (oxidised).
	- 6O2- (l) -> 3O2 (g) + 12e-
	- Then the oxygen bubbles of and reacts with the anode (made of carbon).
	- C (s) + O2  (g) -> CO2 (g)

## Properties of Aluminium:
- bluish silver metal.
- low density.
- good conductor of heat and electricity.
- malleable and ductile.
- resists corrosion, because of the fine coat of aluminium oxide which forms on its surface.
- much stronger when forming alloys.
- non-toxic.
