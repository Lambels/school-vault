## Extraction of Iron:
![[blast_furncace.png]]

- Blast furnace is used.

### Blast Furnace:
- what goes in - charge:
	- Iron Ore (Hematite) - Fe2O3
	- Coke - C
	- Limestone - CaCO3
- uses of coke:
	- displaces the iron from its ore.
	- provides heat in the reaction with oxygen.
- step 3:
	- the carbon monoxide reduces the iron (it loses oxygen)
- what is limestone for:
	- firstly it decomposes in the heat:
		- CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2
	- The calcium oxide now reacts with the sand (SiO2) in the ore:
		- neutralisation reaction.
		- CaO + SiO2 -> CaSiO3 (neutralisation reaction)
		- The calcium silicate forms slag which floats on the iron.
- what goes out:
	- carbon dioxide (from step 3)
	- nitrogen (from the air)

## What happens with the iron next:
- The iron produced from the blast furnace is called pig iron.
	- pig iron = iron impurified with allot of carbon and sand.
- melded pig iron = cast iron.
- pig iron -> steel.
