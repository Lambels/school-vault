## Uses of aluminium:
- overhead electricity cables (good conductor, light)
- cooking foil and food cartons (non-toxic, resistant to corrosion, can be rolled into thin sheets)
- drinking cans (non-toxic, light, resistant to corrosion)
- coating CDS (can be deposited as a thin film, shiny surface reflects laser beam)

## Uses of copper:
- electrical wiring (very good conductor, ductile)
- saucepans (malleable, tough, conducts heat well)

## Uses of zinc:
- protect steal from rusting (sacrificial protection)
- coating or galvanising [[13.5]]
- torch batteries (gives current when connected to carbon pole)

## Alloys:
![[alloys.png]]

- A mix of a molten metal and another substance.
- turning a metal into an alloy changes its properties, and makes it more useful.
- Brass:
	- copper + zinc
	- harder then copper, does not corrode.
	- used in musical instruments, ornaments, door knobs and other fittings.
- Steel:
	- iron + carbon.
	- many variations.
	- see uses + more in [[14.6]].
- Aluminium alloy 7075 TF:
	- aluminium + zinc + magnesium + copper.
	- light but not very strong, does not corrode.
	- used in aircrafts.
