## Extraction and the reactivity series:
![[reactivity_series.png]]

- Under Hydrogen -> no extraction needed (native)
- Under Carbon -> heating with carbon
- Over Carbon -> electrolysis [[8.5]]

## 3 examples of ore extraction:
### 1. Iron Ore - Hematite:
- Hematite is mainly iron (3) oxide.
- Reduced by carbon.

```ad-seealso
Fe2O3 (s) + 3CO (g) -> 2Fe (l) + 3CO2 (g)
```

### 2. Aluminium Ore - Bauxite:
- Aluminium is more reactive then carbon, electrolysis used [[14.4]].

```ad-seealso
2Al2O3 (l) -> 4Al (l) + 3O2 (g)
```

### 3. Zinc Ore - Zinc Blende:
- Zinc blende is mainly ZnS

#### First Step:
- Zinc blende is roasted in air to get zinc oxide.

```ad-seealso
2ZnS (s) + 3O2 (g) -> 2ZnO (s) + 2SO2 (s)
```

#### Second Step:
We are now working with zinc oxide:

- Using Carbon Monoxide:
	- This method creates impurities.
	- Carried out in a furnace.
	- ZnO (s) + CO (g) -> Zn (s) + CO2 (g)
	- The final mixture contains impurities so the zinc is separated using fractional distillation.
- Using Electrolysis:
	- We cannot melt the zinc oxide because it has a very high melting point.
	- We dissolve it in dilute sulfuric acid.
	- Neutralisation reaction occurs and zinc sulfide forms.
	- ZnO + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 (aq) + H2
	- ZnSO4 in electrolysis, the zinc deposits at the cathode.
