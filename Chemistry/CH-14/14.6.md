## Steels:
### Mild Steel:
- iron + little amounts of carbon.
- hard and strong.
- used for buildings, ships, car bodies and machinery.

### Stainless Steel:
- iron + nickel + chromium.
- hard and rustproof.
- used for cutlery, medical equipment and chemical factories.

## Making Steels:
![[oxygen_furnace.png]]

- steels are made from the pig iron from the blast furnace.

### How the furnace works:
1. Molten iron from the blast furnace is poured into the oxygen furnace..
2. Jet of pure oxygen blasted on the molten pig iron.
3. The pure oxygen oxidises the impurities in the pig iron:
	1. Carbon -> carbon dioxide.
	2. Sulfur -> sulfur dioxide.
	3. Phosphorus -> phosphorus (5) oxide.
4. Calcium oxide is added. the calcium oxide is basic and reacts with the acidic oxides to form a slag which is scraped off.
5. Then other elements are added.
