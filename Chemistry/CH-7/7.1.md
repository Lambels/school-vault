## Oxidation: Oxygen is Gained:
$$
\ce{2Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2MgO(s)}
$$
- The magnesium has gained oxygen.
- Similarly you can say that the magnesium has been oxidised.
- **A gain of oxygen is called oxidation.**

## Reduction: Oxygen is Lost:
$$
\ce{CuO (s) + H2 (g) -> Cu (s) + H2O (l)}
$$
- The copper has been reduced by hydrogen. (Hydrogen reduced its compound)
- Similarly you can say that the copper has lost oxygen.
- **A loss of oxygen is called reduction.**

## Oxidation and reduction take place together:
- As seen in the previous equation the copper was reduced and the hydrogen was oxidised.
- **Oxidation and reduction always take place together hence the name redox reactions.**
