## What is oxidation state:
- **Oxidation state tells you how many electrons an atom has gained or lost by making their compound.**

### Some rules:
1. All atoms in a formula have an oxidation state.
2. They are usually denoted using roman numerals.
3. Where an element is not combined with another element its oxidation state is 0.
4. Many elements have the same oxidation state as their valence and this stays constant throughout their compounds:
	- Hydrogen: $\ce{+I}$
	- Group 1 Metals: $\ce{+II}$
	- Group 2 Metals: $\ce{+III}$
	- Halogens in compounds without oxygen: $\ce{-I}$
	- Oxygen (not in peroxides): $\ce{-II}$
5. Transitional metals have variable oxidation states:
	- Iron: $\ce{+II}$, $\ce{+III}$
	- Copper: $\ce{+I}$, $\ce{+II}$
	- Manganese: $\ce{+II}$, $\ce{+IV}$, $\ce{+VII}$
	These oxidation states are included in the name of the compounds: Iron(III) Oxide
6. Oxidation states in a compound add up to 0.
