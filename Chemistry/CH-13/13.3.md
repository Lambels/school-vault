## Metals competition:

### 1. Competition w. Carbon:
- If carbon is more reactive then a metal it can **reduce** its oxide to the metal.
- 2PbO + C -> 2Pb + CO2
	- The metal (Pb) has been reduced.
	- 2Pb2+ + 4e- -> 2Pb (reduction)
	- C -> C4+ + 4e- (oxidation)

### 2. Competing w. metals:
- A more reactive metal will push a less reactive metal out of its compound.
- Fe (s) + CuSO4 (aq) -> FeSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)
	- Fe -> Fe2+ + 2e- (oxidation)
	- Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu (reduction)
	- here the iron is the reducing agent and reduces copper out of its compound.


### 3. Competing to form ions:
![[iron_in_copper_sulfate.png]]
- **A more reactive metal has a higher drive to form ions.**
- In the image above the iron has a higher drive to form ions so it will:
	- reduce the copper ions to make them deposit on the nail.
	- get oxidised and form ions in the solution (solution turns green).
