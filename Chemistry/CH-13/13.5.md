## Making use of reactivity series:
![[reactivity_series.png]]

1. The thermite process:
	- powdered aluminium and iron (3) oxide are used.
	- used to repair cracks in rails.
	- when lit the aluminium reduces the iron oxide to molten iron.
	- this is a displacement reaction (see more [[13.3]])

2. Making simple cells:
	- a simple cell consists of two different metals in a electrolyte.
	- electrons flow from the more reactive metal to the least reactive metal (the more reactive metal gets oxidised).

	- processes occurring in the cell:
		1. the more reactive metal gets oxidised giving of electrons and adding its ions to the solution.
		2. the electrons flow through the wire to the anode (where the least reactive metal is).
		3. lets say the electrolyte contains Na+ Cl- ions, at the anode the least reactive metal will be reduced, hence H + from the water will discharge.

3. Sacrificial protection:
	- when a more reactive metal is paired with a less reactive metal.
	- since the more reactive metal has a bigger drive to form ions, it will oxidise before the less reactive metal.

4. Galvanising:
	- iron or steel coated with zinc.
	- provides mechanical protection.
	- provides chemical protection when damaged.

## The reactivity of aluminium:
- aluminium quickly forms a coat of aluminium oxide on top of it shielding it.
- aluminium behaves as if it were un-reactive.
