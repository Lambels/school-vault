## The reactivity series:
![[reactivity_series.png]]

### The more reactive a metal is:
- The more it tends to form positive ions.
- The more stable compounds it forms.
- The more harder it is to extract from its ore.

## The stability of some metal compounds:
Many compounds break down easily under heating. (thermal decomposition)

- reactive group = potassium, sodium (top)
- mid group = calcium - copper
- un-reactive group = silver, gold (bottom)

### Carbonates:
- Reactive group:
	- **No decomposition.**
- Mid group:
	- **Metal Carbonate -> Metal Oxide + Carbon Dioxide**
- Un-reactive group:
	- **Metal Carbonate -> Metal + Carbon Dioxide + Oxygen**

### Nitrates:
- Reactive group:
	- **Metal Nitrate -> Metal Nitrite + Oxygen**
- Mid group:
	- **Metal Nitrate -> Metal Oxide + Nitrogen Dioxide + Oxygen**
- Un-reactive group:
	- **Metal Nitrate -> Metal + Nitrogen Dioxide + Oxygen**

### Hydroxides:
- Reactive group:
	- **No decomposition.**
- Mid group:
	- **Metal Hydroxides -> Metal Oxide + Water**
- Un-reactive group:
	- **Do not exist**
