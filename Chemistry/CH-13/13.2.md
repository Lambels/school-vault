## Comparing metals reactivity:
2 ways of identifying metals reactivity.

![[reactivity_series.png]]

### 1. Reaction w. Water:
- The more reactive metals (magnesium and above) in reaction with water form hydroxides.
- The less reactive metals form oxides.
- The metals under hydrogen dont react.
```ad-seealso
2Na (s) + 2H2O (l) -> 2NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)

Mg (s) + H2O **(l)** -> Mg(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g)

Mg (s) + H2O **(g)** -> MgO (aq) + H2 (g)
```

### 2. Reaction w. Hydrochloric acid:
- Metals which can displace hydrogen will again react with the acid to form a salt and hydrogen. In this case a chloride.

## Hydrogen is displaced:
- In both of the top examples, hydrogen is displaced.
- If the metal is more reactive it will drive out the hydrogen or *reduce* it.
- The metal taking its place will be oxidised.
