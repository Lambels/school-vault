## Some definitions:
Reversible reactions = reactions that go back and forth but **not in the same time**.
> CuSO4 x 5H20 <=> CuSO4 + 5H2O

Dynamic Equilibrium = reactions that go back and forth **at the same time**.
> N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) <=> 2NH3 (g)
- rate of forward = rate of backwards.
- concentration of reactants and products are constant at equilibrium.

## Le Chatelier's Principle:
When a change is made to a system in equilibrium, the system will oppose the change, trying to go back to equilibrium state.

### Changing the Concentration:
- higher conc. of **reactants** -> equil. **shift to right** where excess is consumed.
- higher conc. of **products** -> equil. **shift to left** where excess is consumed.
- lower conc. of **reactants** -> equil. **shift to left** where excess is produced.
- lower conc. of **products** -> equil. **shift to right** where excess is produced.

### Changing the Temperature:
- temp. is increased -> endothermic reaction favoured.
- temp. is decreased -> exothermic reaction favoured.

### Changing the Pressure:
- affects gaseous systems.
- speeds up rates of all reactions.
- pres. increased -> equilibrium shifts to side with less moles.
- pres. decreased -> equilibrium shifts to side with more moles.

## Haber Process:
![[haber_process.png]]
- Yield: 15%

The hydrogen coming in is obtained by burning methane:
> CH4 (g) + 2H2O (g) -> CO2 (g) + 4H2 (g)

### Optimal Conditions:
- **Low temperature** (forward reaction is exothermic) - 450 deg C are used (cannot go lower, rate will be to slow)
- **High Pressure** (less moles of gas on left side) - 200 atm (too high -> too expensive)
- **Removal Of Ammonia As It Forms** - shift equil. to right.
- **Catalyst** - Fe
