## Making sulfuric acid by Contact process:
This process is very similar to the haber process ([[16.2]]).

**yield: 97%**

- S (s) + O2 (g) -> SO2 (g)
- **SO2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g) <=> SO3 (g)**
- SO3 (g) + H2SO4 (aq) -> H2S2O7 (aq) ( Not SO3 (g) + H2O (l) -> H2SO4 because its too dangerous )
- H2S2O7 (aq) + H2O (l) ->  2H2SO4 (aq)

The sulfur coming in is obtained from PbS (galena) or sulfur beds or sulfur compounds from fossil fuels.
The oxygen coming in is obtained from the air.

### Optimal Conditions:
Although allot more optimisations can be made, the natural yield of the reversible reaction is very high (97%) so not allot of optimisations are needed (cost effective).

- A **temperature** of 450 deg C is used because the catalyst. (compromise since forward reaction is exothermic)
- **Catalyst**: Va2O5.
- **Pressure**: 2 atm.

## Uses of sulfuric acid:
- Fertilisers (potassium sulfate).
- Paints, pigments.
- Fibers and plastics.
- Soaps and detergents.

## Chemical Properties of sulfuric acid:
- + metal -> sulfate + hydrogen
- + base -> salt + water
- + carbonate -> sulfate + carbonic acid -> sulfate + water + carbon dioxide
- + Fe -> FeSO4 + H2
- + CuO -> CuSO4 + H2O
- strong dehydrating agent:
	- removes water from almost everything/
		- for example, it removes water from sugar (glucose C6H12O6) leaving only carbon behind.
	- when mixed with water the reaction gives off allot of heat.
