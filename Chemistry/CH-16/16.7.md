## Carbon Dioxide:
- Occurs naturally in air.
- Product of these reactions:
	- Combustion of carbon compounds in air.
		- Methane...
	- Respiration.
	- Acids and carbonates.

### Properties:
- colourless w. no smell.
- Much heavier then air.
- Things will not burn in it. (doesnt support combustion)
- Slightly soluble in water. Forms carbonic acid.

## Carbon Monoxide:
- Forms when carbon compounds burn in too little oxygen.

### Properties:
- No smell.
- Deadly.

## Carbonates:
- Compounds which contain the CO3 2- ion.
- CaCO3 occurs naturally as limestone. (calcium carbonate)
- React with acids to form: salts, water and CO2.
- Most break down when heated to form: [[13.4]]
	- metal oxide + CO2.
	- Sodium and potassium dont break down.

## Methane:
- CH4
- Found in gas deposits under the ocean floor as natural gas.
- Forms whenever bacteria break down plant material in the absence of oxygen.
- Some animals: cattle, sheep, goats give out methane as a waste gas from the bacteria in their stomach.
