## Where does limestone come from?
- Most creatures in the ocean which have a shell or skeleton, are made from calcium carbonate or limestone.
- When they die, their remains fall to the bottom of the ocean and slowly their remains become limestone rock.
- Their soft parts become oil and gas. [[16.7]]

## Making use of limestone:

## Lime:
- Lime is formed when limestone is decomposed via thermal decomposition:
	- Lime + CO2
- ![[limestone kilt.png]]
	- Lime is produced via a limestone kiln.
	- Although the reaction is reversible air is blow through and carries away the CO2 which prevents it from reacting with the lime to make limestone.

## Slaked Lime:
- Formed when lime is added to water.
- The reaction is exothermic so the water hisses and boils.
- CaO + H2O -> Ca(OH)2
- Used to neutralise acidity in soil and for flue gas desulfurisation.
- Used also to make limewater (weak solution of calcium hydroxide) and test for CO2.

## Cement:
1. Limestone + clay heated strongly in a kiln.
2. Add gypsum.
3. Grind up the final solid in a powder.

## Flue gas desulfurisation:
- The removal of sulfur dioxide from the waste gases at power stations.
- When slaked lime is used:
	- Ca(OH)2 + SO2 -> CaSO3 + H2O
	- CaSO3 + H2O + O2 -> CaSO4 * H2O (gypsum)
- Gypsum is hydrated calcium sulfate.
