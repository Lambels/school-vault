## Carbon, the element:
- Carbon is found in the earths crust in its allotropes:
	- Diamond.
	- Graphite.
- Carbon is also found in its many compounds:
	- In living things.
	- In the ocean.
	- In the atmosphere.

## The Carbon Cycle:
![[carbon cycle.png]]
- CO2 is added to the atmosphere via:
	- Respiration:
		- Decay.
	- Combustion.
- CO2 is removed from the atmosphere via:
	- Photosynthesis.
	- Dissolving in the ocean.

## More in depth:
### Adding:
- Respiration:
	- Done by all living things.
	- Gives out energy.
	- C6H12O6 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O + energy
- Combustion:
	- Combustion of hydrocarbons:
	- CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O + energy
		- Combustion of methane.

### Removing:
- Photosynthesis:
	- Plants preform photosynthesis.
		- Also phytoplankton preforms photosynthesis.
	- 6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2
	- The carbon gets transfered in sugars (glucose) and then gets transfered to the consumer up the food chain.
- Dissolving:
	- Some dissolves in the ocean providing carbonate ions.
		- Shellfish use these along side calcium ions to form their shells which are made from calcium carbonate.
		- Fish also use them in making their skeleton.
	- Only a certain amount of CO2 will dissolve into the ocean, a balance is kept.

## Formation of fossil fuels:
- Bottom of the ocean, dead organisms fall -> petroleum.
- Trees in warm swamps buried -> coal.
