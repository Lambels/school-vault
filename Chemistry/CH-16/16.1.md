## Hydrogen:
- Lightest element
- colourless, odorless
- + O2 -> H2O + **Energy**
- + CuO -> Cu + H2O

## Making Hydrogen in the Lab:
Method used: displacement ([[13.2]])

The reaction between zinc and dilute sulfuric acid is chosen usually:
> Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + **H2**

## Nitrogen:
- Colourless, odourless
- Found in proteins
- Slightly soluble in water
- Un reactive, but it reacts with hydrogen: **N2 + 3H2 <=> 2NH3**
- In special conditions (lighting, high temp), nitrogen reacts with oxygen to form  NO, NO2

## Ammonia:
- Colourless gas, chocking smell.
- Very soluble in water, forming alkaline solution.
- alkali
- less dense then air
- NH3 (g) + HCl (g) -> NH4Cl(s) (white smoke - used to test for presence of ammonia)

## Making Ammonia in the Lab:
- *ammonium salt + strong base*

The reaction between ammonium chloride and calcium hydroxide is chosen usually:
> 2NH4Cl + Ca(OH)2 -> CaCl2 + 2H2O + **2NH3**
