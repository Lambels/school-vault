## Visualizing sounds:
- You can use an oscilloscope.

- Oscilloscopes use voltage / time graphs.
- Using these graphs you can find the frequency and wavelength of the wave.
- Wave amplitudes and pitches:
	- Wave A: High pitch and volume -> High frequency and amplitude.
	- Wave B: Low pitch and high volume -> Low frequency and high amplitude.
	- Wave C: high pitch and low volume -> High frequency and low amplitude.
	- Wave B: Low pitch and volume -> Low frequency and amplitude.

## Echoes:
- Sound waves reflect of hard surfaces.
	- The reflection of a sound wave is called an **echo**.
- Echos can be used to:
	- measure the depth or detect objects under water.
	- echolocation (more about in [[Ultrasound]]).
