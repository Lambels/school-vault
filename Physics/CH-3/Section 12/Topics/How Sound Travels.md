- Sounds are produced by vibrating sources.
	- When the waves makes contact with a solid, the vibrations are transfered to the solid.
- Sound waves are longitudinal and hence need a medium.

- The molecules travel back and forth with no net movement, parallel to the direction of energy transfer.

- when a longitudinal wave travels, it does so in compressions and rarefactions:
	- rarefaction: region of low density and pressure where molecules are more spread out.
	- compression: region of high density and pressure where molecules are bunched up together.
- the changes of pressure throughout the sound wave classify it as a **pressure wave**.
- these fluctuations in pressure cause a solid (when hit by a sound wave) to vibrate in sink with the wave.
