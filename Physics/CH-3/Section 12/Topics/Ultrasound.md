- [[Ultrasound]]s are waves with frequencies higher then 20,000 Hz.

## Properties of Ultrasound:
- When ultrasounds reach the boundary between two mediums some of the waves are partially deflected.
- The remainder of the waves continue travelling.
- Ultrasound transducers are able to:
	- Emit ultrasound.
	- Receive ultrasound.
- Time taken for a reflection to reach the receiver can be used to deduce how far away a boundary is.
