- Speed of sound in air:
	- The higher the air temperature the higher the speed of sound.
	- The speed is around 350 m/s .
- Speed of sound in materials:
	- Sound travels fastest in **solids**.
	- Sound travels slowest in **gases**.

## Measuring the speed of sound.

### Between two points:
![[msr_spd1.png]]
1. People stand at a distance of 100 m.
2. The first person bangs two wooden blocks.
3. The second person starts the stopwatch when they see that the first person banged the blocks.
4. Then when the second person hears the noise she stops the watch.
5. v = d/t

### Using an oscilloscope:
![[msf_spd3.png]]
1. Microphones are connected to an oscilloscope separated by a few meters.
2. A sound is made next to the first microphone.
3. Oscilloscope used to determine the time at which the sound reaches each microphone.
4. v = d (between mics)/ t (d between peaks)
