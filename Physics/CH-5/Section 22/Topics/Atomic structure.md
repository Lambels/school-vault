# The Atom:
- Atoms are the building block of all atoms.
- Dense nucleus at the center:
	- Contains protons and neutrons.
- Electrons orbit the nucleus.
- The radius is very small compared to the atom, yet it makes up almost all the mass.

## Ions:
- An electrically charged atom. (see more about charges in [[Protons, neutrons and electrons]]).
- Atoms will gain or lose electrons to become more stable (form compounds.) (have a stable electron configuration.)
- Electrically neutral -> same number of protons and electrons.
- Positive ions are formed when an atom loses electrons.
- Negative ions are formed when an atom gains electrons.

# Rutherford's Experiment:
- The scientist shot $\alpha$ particles ($\ce{He^2+}$ ions, 2 protons + 2 nucleons) at a thin sheet of gold.
- Before, they expected that with the plum model, no particles would pass through the thin sheet of gold.
- Instead Rutherford expected that the alpha particles would pass through the gold atoms, and maybe change direction a small amount.

## What they discovered:
- **Most of the alpha particles went straight through the gold foil.**
	- This happens because the atom is mainly empty space.
- **Some alpha particles passed through the foil but changed direction.**
	- This happens because the alpha particles are repelled by the positive nucleus which contains most of its mass.
	- Or because they hit it slightly.
- **A few particles bounced back from the foil.**
	- The small $\ce{He^2+}$ hit the big gold nucleus and bounce back.

# The Nucleus:
- Positively charged nucleus (at the center).
	- Protons positive charge.
	- Neutrons no charge.
	- NET positive.
- Negatively charged electrons orbiting around center.

## Proton Number:
- **Z**
- Number of protons in an atom.
- Determines what element the atom is.
- The atomic number is equal to the number of electrons in an atom. (not ion)
- Also called Atomic Number.

## Nucleon Number:
- **A**
- The total number of particles in the nucleus is called the Nucleon Number. (or mass number)
- This is where the mass comes from.
- Number of neutrons found by subtracting **A** - **Z**.

## Nuclide Notation:
- ![[Pasted image 20221206200103.png]]
- A nuclide is a group of atoms containing the same number of protons and neutrons.
- Mass Number -> Nucleon Number. (chemistry -> physics)
- Atomic Number -> Proton Number. (chemistry -> physics)
- Nucleon refers to a particle in the nucleus. (proton or neutron)
- Nuclide refers to a nucleus with a specific number of nucleons and protons.

## Isotopes:
- Although the number of protons (proton number) remains constant, the number of neutrons can change (nucleon number).
- **Isotopes** are atoms of the same element with different number of neutrons.
- Isotopes tend to be more unstable due to their in-balance of protons and neutrons.
	- This means they are more likely to decay.

	- *notice how the number of protons stays constant.*

# Plum model:
- Mass distributed evenly.
- Mass of positive charge and electrons flow around it.
- Plum model has no nucleons.
- Only talked about positive and negative charge.
