# Quantities and Units:
- ![[Pasted image 20221206201712.png]]
- Relative mass measured in **amu**.
- Magnitude of charge of protons and electrons is equal, yet its opposite.

## Nuclear Charge:
- Relative charge of the nucleus.
- Neutrons dont have charge.
- $\ce{^{52}_{24}Cr}$ -> 24 * 1+ = +24

## Nuclear Mass:
- Relative mass of the nucleus.
- Nucleon number (mass number) determines the relative mass of the nucleus.
	- Neutrons + Protons.
- $\ce{^{52}_{24}Cr}$ -> 52 amu.
