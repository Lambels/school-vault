# Nuclear Fission:
- There is allot of energy stored in the nucleus of an atom.
	- This energy is released in a nuclear reaction called **nuclear fission**.
- **Nuclear fission is the splitting of large, unstable nucleus into two smaller nuclei.**

- Isotopes of uranium and plutonium are both used in **nuclear fission**.
- When a neutron hits an unstable nucleus, it splits into two smaller nuclei (daughter cells) and 2 or 3 neutrons.
	- Gamma rays are also emitted.

- **In fission the products**:
	- Move away quickly.
	- Gain kinetic energy (transfered from nuclear potential energy).
	- Mass is less then the mass of the original nucleus. (remaining mass converted into energy)

## Nuclide equation:
$$
\ce{^{235}_{92}U + ^{1}_{0}n -> ^{92}_{36}Kr + ^{141}_{56}Ba + 3^{1}_{0}n + energy}
$$
- The equation above represents a fission reaction where uranium 235 is hit with a neutron and its nucleus is split into two smaller nuclei (krypton and barium) releasing 3 neutrons in the process.
- Symbols represent:
	- $\ce{^{235}_{92}U}$ is an unstable isotope of Uranium.
	- $\ce{^{1}_{0}n}$ is a neutron.
	- $\ce{^{92}_{36}Kr}$ is an unstable isotope of Krypton.
	- $\ce{^{141}_{56}Ba}$ is an unstable isotope of Barium.
- The sum of the:
	- Nucleon number on the left = Nucleon number on the right.
	- Proton number on the left = Proton number on the right.

# Nuclear Fusion:
- Small nuclei can react to release energy in a process  called **nuclear fusion**.
- **When two light nuclei join to form a heavier nucleus.**
- This process requires extremely high temperatures to maintain.
	- Very hard to reproduce on earth.
- Nuclear fusion is used in stars to produce energy.
	- Hydrogen atoms are used to form helium and produce allot of energy.
$$
\ce{^{2}_{1}H + ^{3}_{1}H -> ^{4}_{2}He + ^{1}_{0}n + energy}
$$
- **Deuterium** and **Tritium** react in a fusion reaction to make **Helium - 4** and a neutron + allot of energy. 
- When the reaction occurs, some mass is lost into energy.
	- This can be put into an equation.
$$
E = m \cdot c^2
$$
- Where:
	- $E$ = energy released from fusion in Joules. (J)
	- $m$ = mass lost (converted to energy). (kg)
	- $c$ = speed of light. (m/s)

- There are huge amounts of energy released by nuclear fusion. The energy from the fusion of 1 kg of hydrogen is equivalent from the energy released from burning 10 million kilograms for coal.
