## Background Radiation:

- Radioactivity is a natural activity.
- **Background radiation is the radiation that exists around us all the time.**
- Two main sources:
	- Man made
	- Natural
- When you come in contact with radiation you can either get **irradiated** or **contaminated**:
	- **irradiated**: If the radiation emitted from a radioactive material hits us, we become irradiated.
	- **contaminated**: if a radioactive substance gets inside us we say that we are contaminated.

### Sources of Natural Background Radiation:
1. Radon: Radon is the radioactive gas in our atmosphere. The uranium rocks in the earths crust emanate the radon which seeps up to the Earths surface. We breath in the radon gas in the atmosphere, this contributes to about half of the radiation intake a person usually receives.
2. The ground contains radioactive materials which we bring up to build roads and what not. We get exposed by that.
3. The food we eat is radioactive, when plants take in nutrients from the soil or living things in general take in radiation through the air or other mediums we being up the food chain ingest them along side the radiation.
4. Radiation also reaches us from the cosmos, via cosmic rays. Most are blocked by the atmosphere but some still get to us. For example if you live up on a mountain you will be exposed to more radiation.
5. Carbon-14 in biological material. All biological materials contain a little bit of carbon 14.

### Sources of Man-made Radiation:
1. Medical sources (most significant): It includes X-rays, CT scans, radioactive traces and radioactive therapy.
2. Nuclear waste: The nuclear waste doesnt contaminate allot itself, it is more of a problem to the people handling it.
3. Nuclear fallout: Fallout is the residue of radioactive material that is thrown into the air after a nuclear explosion. This is very area specific being very concentrated into the places where the bomb was detonated.
	- Nuclear accidents.

## Detecting radiation:
- Ionising radiation is measured by using a detector connected to a counter.
- Radiation is measured by a count rate or **counts/sec**.

### Count Rate:
- Count rate is the number of radioactive decays per second. [[Radioactive decay]]
- The count rate decreases the further you move from the radiation source.

### Geiger-Muller tube:
- Each time it absorbs/detects radiation it sends an electric pulse to the counting machine.
	- The counting machine makes a clicking sound each time it receives a pulse, this displays the count rate.
