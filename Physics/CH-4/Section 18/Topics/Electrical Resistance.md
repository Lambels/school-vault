- As [[Electrons]] pass through a wire they collide with the metal ions in the wire (metal).
	- ![[resistance.png]]
	- The ions get in the way of the [[Electrons]], resisting their flow.
		- The longer the wire -> higher resistance. (DP)
		- The thicker the wire -> smaller resistance. (IP)
		- The denser the wire -> higher resistance.

## Ohm's Law:
- The current is dp to the potential difference as long as the temperature remains constant.
```ad-seealso
V = I * R
```
- Resistance remains constant for ohmic resistors.
