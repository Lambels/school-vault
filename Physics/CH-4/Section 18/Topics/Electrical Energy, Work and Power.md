## Energy:
- Electrical energy is a type of energy like thermal or chemical energy.
- The amount of energy transfered depends on:
	- How long the device is switched on.
	- The power of the device.
- To calculate the electrical energy:
```ad-seealso
E = V \* I \* t
```
- E (Joules)
- V (Volts)
- I (Amps)
- t (Seconds)

## Power:
- Power in mechanics is defined as the work done per unit time.
	- The potential difference is the work done per charge.
	- And the intensity or current is the rate of flow of charge.
- Hence power is:
```ad-seealso
P = W/t
```
- W = work done or energy transfered
- P = work done per second.
- But power can also be written as:
```ad-seealso
P = I * V
```
- Which makes sense when you realise that the charge (coloumb) unit cancels out and what remains is work done per unit time.

- You could also substitute Ohms law:
```ad-seealso
P = I^2 * R
```
