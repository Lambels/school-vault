 Current and [[Voltage in Electric Circuits]] work together to describe what happens in an electrical circuit.
- Current describes the flow of charge or [[Electrons]] through the circuit.
	- Current is a **rate**.
		- Charge per unit time.
	- Def: **Current is the amount of charge passing through a point every second.**

I = Q / t

## DC and AC Current:
![[ac_vs_dc.png]]

- DC (Direct Curent):
	- It is usually obtained by using a dry cell or battery.
	- [[Electrons]] flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal in one direction only.
- AC (Alternating Current):
	- It usually comes from most generators.
	- Needed for transformers. ([[How transformers work]])
	- Typical frequency for the reversal of AC current is 50 Hz.

## Measuring Current:

## Conventional Flow:
- Opposite to the flow of electrons.
