- Voltage is measured as energy done per charge.
- As the [[Electrons]] or charge flow through a circuit, energy is transferred to or from the charge.

## Potential Difference:
- Potential Difference or PD is measured in volts and shows the amount of energy transfered per charge between two points in a circuit.
```ad-seealso
PD (V) = WD / C
```
- Where WD = work done by the charge.

- The total potential difference adds up to the EMF.

### Measuring potential difference:
- Use a voltmeter.
- Connect it in parallel to the component(s) you want to measure the potential difference across.

## EMF (Electromotive Force):
- EMF or Electromotive Force is measured in volts and shows the amount of energy transfered to the charge or [[Electrons]].
```ad-seealso
EMF (V) = WD / C
```
- Where WD = work done on the charge.
- This is the place in the circuit where energy is re supplied to the charge so that it can be carried to the components potential difference.
