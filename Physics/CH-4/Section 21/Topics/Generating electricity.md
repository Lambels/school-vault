*when putting the magnet in the system the system tries to push it out via magnetic fields*

Using flemings right hand law, you can induce the direction of the current, then using the grip law [[The magnetic effect of a current]] you can see that the coil creates an magnetic field which pushes the magnet out (if you are pushing it in) or pulls the magnet in (if you are pulling it out).

## Faradays Experiment:
- Faraday found out that a steady magnetic field wont produce a steady current. A changing magnetic field will cause a current (AC) - this will be used int [[How transformers work]].
- A current can be induced by a changing magnetic field - Electromagnetic Induction.
- The process of generating electricity from motion is called electromagnetic induction.

## Flemings Right Hand Rule:
- Used to find the induced current from the force and b field interaction.
- The current created will create a B field which will resist the motion.

## AC Generators

- The armature is forced to spin in a uniform magnetic field and the current generated will be in the form of AC current.

	- This graph shows the alternation of the current as the armature spins.
	- The EMF is the highest when the position is horizontal since this way the magnetic field lines cut through the most fields.
	- The EMF is lowest when the magnetic field lines are parallel to one another. (vertical)
