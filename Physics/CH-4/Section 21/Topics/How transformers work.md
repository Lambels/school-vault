- A transformer is an electrical device used to increase or decrease the potential difference of an alternative current.

- The basic transformer consists of:
	- A primary coil.
	- A secondary coil.
	- A soft iron core.
- Iron is used because it is magnetically soft.

	1. An AC current is supplied to the primary coil. (Keep in mind Faradays Experiment - AC has a change in charge).
	2. The current is continuously changing direction hence a changing magnetic field in the primary coil, now we have a **generator effect**.
	3. The magnetically soft core is easily magnetised and de magnetised hence the magnetic field easily passes through it.
	4. The changing magnetic field enters the secondary coil.
		1. This changing field induces a potential difference. (Faradays Experiment)
		2. The AC current continues to flow with the **same frequency**.

## Step-up or Step-down?
- A step up transformer increases the potential difference of a power source.
	- More turns on the secondary coil.
- A step down transformer decreases the potential difference of a power source.
	- More turns on the primary coil.


## Some calculations:
- The output on a transformer depends on the number of turns in each coil.
- This can be put in a relation:
$$
\frac{V}{V} = \frac{f}{f}
$$
