## What are magnets?
![[bar_magnet.png]]
- This is a simple magnet.
- It has 2 poles:
	- North
	- South
- Opposite poles attract.
- Like poles repel.
- Poles attract magnetic materials which arent magnetised and induce magnetism.

## Magnetic Materials:
- Iron, cobalt, nickel.
	- These magnetic materials interact with magnetic fields.
- Materials which make permanent magnets are described as magnetically hard:
	- They are usually alloys ([[14.5]]) of iron, nickel or cobalt.
- Magnetically soft materials are easily magnetised and de magnetised.

## Two Types of Magnets:
- Permanent.
- Induced.

### Permanent:
- These are made from magnetically hard materials like steel and other alloys..
- It will produce its own magnetic field and not lose it.

### Induced:
- Made from magnetically hard or soft materials.
	- Although magnetically hard magnets tend to hold their magnetism after it is induced.
	- Magnetically soft materials like iron lose it as soon as they are no longer in contact with any [[Magnetic Fields]].
- Magnetic materials will always be attracted to a magnet:
