- All magnets are surrounded by a magnetic field (or B field).
	- Definition: The region around a magnet which interacts with another magnetic material.
- A uniform magnetic field can be produced by holding two magnets with opposite poles close to each other. It will look like this:

*note: magnetic fields flow from north -> south.*
*note: when drawing magnetic fields use arrows.*

- A uniform magnetic field has the same strength at all points:
- Strength of the magnetic field depends on how close the magnetic field lines are to one another.
- Fields can be determined using **iron fillings** or a **plotting compass**.

- Magnetic forces are due to interactions between magnetic fields.
