## Flemings Left Hand Rule:
![[fleming_rule.png]]
When two magnets are intersected motion is observed -> a force is present:
- The middle finger -> the current in the cable in the conventional flow (has magnetic field)
- The index finger -> b fields from permanent magnet
- The thumb -> since we have two magnetic fields, the thumb will be the direction of the force

## Loud Speaker:

The magnetic fields between the permanent magnet (**index finger**) and current (**middle finger**) causes a force (**thumb**) to move the paper cone and cause a disturbance in the air (sound wave).
