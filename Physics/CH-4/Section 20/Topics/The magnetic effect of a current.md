## Right Hand Grip Rule
![[right_hand_grip_rule.png]]
When electrons move through a wire (because of a potential difference) they create a magnetic field.

When the current flows through a loop (solenoid) the magnetic field gets amplified inside since the magnetic fields are closer to each other.

## Measuring The Magnetic Field:

Putting the wire through cardboard and putting plotting compasses around it will show the direction of the magnetic field, increasing the resistance in the wire will cause a weaker (sparser) magnetic field. 

## Relay:

- When the switch (A) gets closed the core of the electromagnet made from a magnetically soft material will get magnetised.
- The electromagnet will attract the iron armature and will push the springy metal up and the contact points (B) will make contact completing the circuit.
- The current will now be redirected.
