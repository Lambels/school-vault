- The magnetic field can also be used to deflect or attract a beam of electrons, or any charged particles. This can be demonstrated using a vacuum tube.
- There is a magnetic field on both the permanent magnet and the beam of electrons, the same way there is on a current carrying conductor.
- We can use flemings left hand rule, but now we aren't talking about the conventional flow, we are talking about the electron flow so its opposite.
