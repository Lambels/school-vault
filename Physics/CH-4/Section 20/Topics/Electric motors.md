The simple d.c motor consists of a coil of wire (armature) which is free to move positioned in a uniform [[Magnetic Fields]], this causes the coil to rotate since it experiences a turning effect.

The turning effect can be amplified by:
- The number of turns on the armature.
- The current.
- The strength of the magnetic fields.

### Keywords:
- armature = coil of wire which gets electromagnetised, spins with the permanent magnetic fields. *flemings left hand law*
- commutator = fixed to the rear ends of the armature and spins with it, it reverses the poles on the magnet to get the turning effect.
- brushes = keeps contact with the commutator and pass electricity through it, when they pass through the commutator's gap's the poles on the armature get reversed and the motor continues spinning.

## How It Works:
- When the current is flowing through the armature coil a magnetic field is being experienced ([[The magnetic effect of a current]]).
	- This magnetic field interacts with the field of the uniform field of the magnets (strongest when at 90 deg to the B field - see more: [[Force on a current-carrying conductor]])
