# METADATA:
- Tensions between USSR and USA were at an all time high.
- They took every chance to openly criticise each others policies.

# The Root Of The Problem - Germany:
- After the war at the [[1945 02, Yalta Conference]] Germany was split into 4 parts.
- Initially Germany was meant to be an agricultural country under the Morgenthau plan, but Truman believed that West Germany could be a strong ally to USA so he built it strong. (Red flag to Russia).
- In 1946 Britain, France and USA combined their zones into Trizonia, this was found as offensive by Stalin.
- Britain, France and the USA introduced a new 'safe' currency, the Deutschmark, into Trizonia on which angered the USSR.

# The Berlin Blockade:
- The main reason for this action was that if the westerns could merge up their zones Stalin could retaliate via the Berlin Blockade.
- Also Stalin wanted to kick out the allies from Berlin.
- Any act to pass resources into Berlin would be taken as an act of war.

## Response to The Berlin Blockade:
- [[Berlin Airlift]]
- [[NATO]]
- [[Warsaw Pact]]
