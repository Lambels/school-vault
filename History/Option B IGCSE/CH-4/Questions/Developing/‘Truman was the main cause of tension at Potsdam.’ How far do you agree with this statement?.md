	- Truman had deliberately delayed the Potsdam meeting so that America could test the atomic bomb.
	- Truman was much more anti communist and suspicious of Stalin then Roosevelt.
	- He publicly announced that Russia had to be faced with an *iron fist* [[Truman Doctrine]].
- Truman was the main cause of Tension at [[1945 07, Potsdam Conference]] because of his absence in the [[1945 02, Yalta Conference]].
	- Many promises and agreements were made *unofficially* at [[1945 02, Yalta Conference]] between Stalin and Roosevelt.
	- Stalin and Roosevelt discussed on the idea of the Soviet Sphere which was an already ambiguous term with Roosevelt in much more detail then with Truman, when Truman came to the [[1945 07, Potsdam Conference]] there were huge misunderstandings between Stalin and Truman on the term Soviet Sphere of Influence hence the tension.

## CON:
- The absence of Churchill.
	- In the middle of the conference Churchill lost an election over in Britain and had to be replaced by Clement Attlee.
	- In the absence of Churchill the whole dynamic of the conference shifted upon the rivalry and suspicion between Stalin and Truman.
	- Clement Attlee wasnt interested in Foreign Politics.
- The common threat of Hitler was now gone.
	- In May 1945 Hitler committed suicide and Nazi Germany crippled.
	- What arguably made the [[1945 02, Yalta Conference]] so smooth was the common threat keeping the big 3 from arguing.
	- Now that Hitler was dead, there was nothing keeping the 2 from arguing.
