# METADATA
- Germany was in a horrible state, socially, economically and morally.
- Germany was a previously strong empire which is now in a horrible state.
- The Germans expected a fair Treaty to help them build the Weimar Republic.
- [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Lloyd George]], [[Georges Clemenceau]] were the big 3.
- The treaty would deal with Germany and all its allies.
- None of the countries who lost were invited to represent their countries.
- It lasted 12 months.
- Took place at the palace of Versailles next to Paris.

# Wilsons ideas:
- [[Woodrow Wilson]] arrived in Paris as a saintly figure, a saviour for the open world.
- He was going to install safe and fair peace.

### How would he achieve this?
- Dont be to harsh on Germany.
	- Woodrow Wilson believed that Germany should be punished.
	- However he didnt want Germany to be punished harshly for 2 reasons:
		1. He didnt want Germany to seek revenge once they were back to power.
		2. He didnt want any extremist groups like communist to take advantage of the crisis like they did in Russia 1917.
- Strengthen democracy in defeated countries.
	- In Wilsons eyes, democracy was key to peace in Europe.
	- If leaders in defeated nations had to listen to their people and gain their votes he wouldnt be able to start another war.
- Give self determination to small countries that had once been part of the European empires.
	- He wanted people in the Eastern Europe rule themselves (Poland, Czechs and Slovaks) rather then being part of a large empire like Austria-Hungary.
- International Co-operation.
	- Wilson believed that nations should co-operate on a world level to achieve world peace.
	- This will come in the form of [[League Of Nations]], Wilson's most important point out of his [[The 14 Points]].

- Although Willson was an idealist he wasnt to be messed with or pushed around, he refused to cancel depts owed to the USA by Britain to make sure that they would agree with him.

## Did the rest agree with Wilson?
- Openly everyone agreed since no one can stan up in public against peace.
- They were however skeptical on the **Independence of Eastern Europe** points:
	- Allot of the people in Eastern Europe were spread around the continent, there was really no country with native sovereignty hence if borders were drawn allot of people will find themselves in a country where they didnt understand the language and couldnt call home.
	- Also allot of people were skeptical of Wilsons understanding of the East which was compulsionary when taking such big decisions.
- Moreover its very hard to place 2 realists (Lloyd and Clemenceau) who were, in contrast to Woodrow, actually affected by the war and didnt just bring up their Idealist fairy tail 14 points and actually had people home demanding that Germany would pay for the damage dealt to their homes.

### [[Lloyd George]] viewpoints:
- In public Lloyd George openly agreed with Wilson and his ideas.
- In private Lloyd George was less positive and complained to one of his officials that Wilson has arrived to Paris like a missionary with his little sermons and lectures without having any actual physical plan or motive.
- Although he did agree with Wilson on many issues, for example he agreed that **Germany should be punished but not to harsh**. The same way Wilson was scared that the Germans would seek revenge later, Lloyd was deeply concerned also, as Wilson, about a potential communist revolution in Germany similar to the Russian one in 1917.
- Also before the war, Germany was one of Britains biggest trading partener and Lloyd wanted the trading to come back asap. Like it or not it would generate allot of jobs in Britain.
- However Lloyd George was much closer to the action then Wilson and also had the British empire in mind. He wanted Germany to lose its navy and its colonies since they were all a threat to the British Empire.

#### Pressure on Lloyd George:
- People in Britain werent sympathetic in any way towards Germany:
	- They had 1 million casualties.
	- They had hardships at home with food shortages.
	- They had been fed 4 years of anti Germany propaganda.
	- They have seen how Germany treated Russia when they lost stripping them of 25% of their population.
- Lloyd won the elections by the slogan 'Make Germany Pay' even if he knew of the risks this could have, he now had to find a sweet-spot of severity.

### [[Georges Clemenceau]] viewpoints:
- In public yet again, Georges couldnt stand up against Woodrow and his long lasting peace.
- He did however find Wilson very hard to work with.
- He didnt criticise his 14 points allot, but once pointed out that 'even god had only 10 commandments'.
- Their major disagreements were over Germany:
	- Woodrow wanted a stabil future Germany.
	- The French officials saw this as an opportunity to crush and cripple Germany so that they wouldnt invade France ever again.
- Realist, knew that he had to work with some people to reach his claims.

#### Pressure on Clemenceau:
- French similarly to Britain, but much worse, had suffered damages to almost all aspects (people, land, industry).
- For the French, Germany was still a formidable oponent.
	- Their population was in decline and much smaller then their counter part Germany.
	- They had lost most of their fighting power and capabilities of defensive after 2/3 of young soldiers died in the war.
- The French president reinforced with this idea even saying that Germany should be divided in small states.

# How did the Peace Making Process Go?
- It was impossible that all terms would be agreed upon.
- Lloyd very selfish for acting only in the British Empires interests.
- Wilson with his idealist views.
- Clemenceau disperate to crush Germany and secure France.

## Clemenceau clashed with Wilson usually:
- USA has not suffered even of fraction of what France suffered in the war.
	- Clemenceau resented Wilsons more laid off attitude.
- The disagreed over what to do with the Rhineland and coalfields in the Saar.
- Wilson gave in to Clemenceau demands:
	- In return he didnt clash with Wilsons views over the East, but these changes came in the form of other treaties:
		- [[1919, The Treaty Of St Germain]] - Austria
		- [[1920, The Treaty Of Sevres]] - Turkey
		- [[1919, The Treaty Of Neuilly]] - Bulgaria
		- [[1920, The Treaty Of Trianon]] - Hungary

## Clemenceau clashed with Lloyd some times:
- The main disagreement was also over the light hearted approach of the British to punish the Germans.
	- Not only the magnitude of punishment was the problem, but also the intensions.
- The British did want to punish Germany but im a very selfish manner. The only thing they were concerned about was the German navy which was the only tool the Germans could use to pose actual threat to the British, but they completely ignored that even a Germany without a navy could still pose a great threat to the French. The French and Clemenceau saw this as an act in self interest and not a push for the greater good.

## Wilson and Lloyd didnt always agree:
- Lloyd disagreed with the point (of the 14 points of Wilsons) that everyone should have access to the open sea.
- Lloyd also disagreed with Wilsons views on people leading themselves as they were threatening the British Empire which ruled millions of people outside London.

# The terms of the Treaty.
- 5 main areas.

## War Guilt:
- This clause was simple yet very de moralising and got resented by the Germans.
- It blamed Germany for starting the war.

## Reparations:
- All major powers agreed, without consulting Germany, that Germany would have to finance the majority of the war.
- In 1921 the enormous price tag on the war was valued at around $ 6,600 million, price payed by the Germans.
- If the terms wouldnt have changed under [[The Young Plan]] Germany would have continued to pay the bill till 1984.

## German territories and colonies:
### Europe:
- Prevented Anschluss.
- Polish corridor (separated many Germans).
- West Prussia to Poland.
- Upper Silesia to Poland.
- Saarland ruled by [[League Of Nations]] to be held up for Plebiscites in 15 years.
- Alsace Loraine given to France.
- Rhineland demilitarised.
- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became independent states (they had been taken by Germany from Russia).
### Oversees:
- Former German colonies such as Cameroon were now in control of the [[League Of Nations]] which basically handed them in to Britain and France.
- This used to be a massive hot topic between Germany and Britain.

## German Armed Forces:
- Limit to 100,000 soldiers.
- Conscription was banned, you now needed to volunteer to be in the German Army.
- Germany wasnt allowed any armoured vehicles, submarines or aircrafts.
- Navy could only hold 6 battleships.
- The border between Germany and France was demilitarised (Rhineland).

## [[League Of Nations]]:
- Police force to keep peace.

All these terms really hit an already kneeling Germany hard:
