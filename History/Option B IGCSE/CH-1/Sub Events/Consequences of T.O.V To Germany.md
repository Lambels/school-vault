## Resentment and Criticism:
![[German Criticism of T.O.V.canvas]]
*mind map shows the resentment towards specific points*

## Political Violence:
- The right winged opponents to [[Friedrich Ebert]]s Government resented [[1919, The Treaty Of Versailles]]. They had attempted a revolution called the [[Kapp Putsch]] which was defeated by a general strike in Germany. The strike was carried out by Berlin workers which paralysed essential services such as transport and power. This saved Ebert's government and only created more chaos and resentment towards the Treaty in Germany.
- The political violence didnt stop there, there were frequent assassination attempts or murders on high profile politicians such as the murder of The Foreign Minister who was murdered by an extremist.
- Then also in November 1923 Adolf Hitler launched his own revolution attempt in the form of the [[Munich Putsch]] where he got arrested but proceeded to be left of lightly since most Germans shared his view of resentment to the Treaty.

## Conflict in the Ruhr:
- In 1922 nothing was payed by the Germans. Ebert tried to negotiate the terms of the Treaty to ease the sum of $ 6,600 million.
- The French ran out of patience and invaded the Ruhr (which was demilitarised) with the intention to claim what they havent received from the Germans in the form of raw materials.
	- This was legal in the eyes of The T.O.V
- The German government replied with demanding that the German workers in the Ruhr to stop working so they wouldnt generate money for the French.
	- This meant that the Germans had no goods to trade and no money to buy goods with. This lead to [Hyperinflation](Consequences of T.O.V To Germany##Hyperinflation).
- The French killed 100 or so workers and expelled over 100,000 workers. This was a quite unified response from the Germans.

### Why didnt the Germans just Pay?
- There is allot of debate on the developments of the Ruhr crisis.
1. Germany had no money and the reparation costs were way to high and Germany was virtually bankrupt.
2. The French and British argued that the Germans could have payed but just didnt want to!
3. Some historians argue that all of the Ruhr crisis was a tool to get global attention on the situation Germany was in and potentially revise the terms of the treaty.

## Hyperinflation:
- The Germans solved the problem of not having enough money (to buy goods, support the strike in the Ruhr) by simply printing more money, but this came with a down side - hyperinflation.
- The money was virtually worthless, wages began to be payed daily.

### How did it affect the people:
- The government and big industrialists gained from this crisis, they could now pay huge depts in worthless marks.
- But normals ranked people were hit hard:
	- Pensionaries were left penniless.
	- Middle class families who saved money to buy a house could now buy a loaf of bread with that money.
- Germany eventually recovered from the disaster but it left German people with a bitter taste towards the Treaty Of Versailles. When Germany faced economic problems in 1929 again it was easy for Hitler to throw the blame on the Treaty which resonated with allot of people.

> [!ABSTRACT] Chat-GPT on the 1929 crisis
> Germany faced a number of economic problems in 1929. One major problem was that the country had a high level of debt due to World War I reparations, which made it difficult for the government to fund necessary projects and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the German economy was heavily dependent on exports, and the worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 led to a significant decline in demand for German goods, which hurt the country's economy. Finally, the German banking system was fragile and susceptible to runs, which exacerbated the economic crisis and contributed to the collapse of the German banking system in the early 1930s.
