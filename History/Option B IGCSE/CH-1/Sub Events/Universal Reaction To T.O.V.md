# Reactions at that time:
## The treaty was unfair:
- None of the Big 3 were satisfied with the treaty.
	- They all had different reasons.
- ![[Pasted image 20230108122004.png]]
	- This was a very popular cartoon during the period after the [[1919, The Treaty Of Versailles]].
	- It showed the big three and the French leader: [[Georges Clemenceau]] (The Tiger) noticing a child weeping.
	- Over the child's head, it reads class of 1940 which will be the future children which will fight the war of the Treaty (WW2).
	- History proved this carton right.


## The treaty was fair:
- After most of Germany's complaints fell on deaf years, people in France and Britain were celebrating the Treaty.
- Heck, most thought that the Treaty shouldve been more harsh.

- Many people felt that Germany were operating on double standards. Their pledges for a fairer treatment didnt match the Treaty they gave Russia in 1918 with the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Versailles was a relatively laid off treaty in comparison to the Brest-Litovsk.
- Also most of all German economic problems were self inflicted. Other states raised taxes to pay for the war. Germany didnt, they allowed the depts to build up and and planned to pay the depts by collecting reparations from defeated states.
