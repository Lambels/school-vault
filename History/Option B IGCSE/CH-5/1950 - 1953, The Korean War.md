# METADATA:
- 1950 - 1953
- War between communists (The North) and capitalists - not democratic (The South)
- Northern half liberated by soviets and Southern by Americans after WW2.
- Hostility between South and North -> All out war in 1950 (south apprehended quickly).

# US Involvement:
Since president Truman was still in power he still had his [[Truman Doctrine]] views, and the Korean war was the perfect example of communism trying to spread. He took it as his job to contain this spread of communism.

### Response:
Truman immediately sent: **military advisers**, **supplies** and **warships** to the seas around Korea.

Although he sent all these supplies, he did everything short of war.
He knew that he had to get the **United Nations** involved on this so that these actions wouldnt look solitary, but embraced throughout the world.

# United Nations Involvement:
Resolution 84 was passed in 1950 which basically stated that they were all in on the war.

### Reasons The [[United Nations]] Agreed:
- USA was the single biggest contributor to the UN Budget and was very influential with its decisions
- USSR was **boycotting** the UN over another issue at this time (China's Involvement in UN) -> USSR not even present at meeting when resolution passed.
- Fear of repeating the L.O.N problems. [[The Domino Effect]] could occur.

# Development Of The War:
Context: South pushed back to Pusan by North forces.

### September 1950 - The UN advance:
- UN forces land ashore Inchon in September 1950. Together with the forces trapped in Pusan (South Koreans and UN forces) they push through the original border within weeks.

### October 1950 - The UN forces presses on:
- Initial aim achieved by this point (push north Koreans out the south).
- Americans not satisfied - they wanted to abolish communism entirely, they had a bigger goal. Even if China was threatening to join the war (at this point the UN pushed up to chinas borders).

### November 1950 - The UN forces retreat:
- China launches harsh offensive under the name of 200,000 soldiers (Peoples Volunteers).
- They had modern tanks and were used to the weather and terrain.

### April 1951 - MacArthur is sacked:
- MacArthur was in charge of this whole attack and insisted to push forward into china.
- He openly threatened china without USA's approval.
- He wanted to push more then containment -> eradication of communism.
- He fell out with Truman.

### June 1951 - Peace talks begin:
- Peace talks between the south and north.
- At this point the border was still along the 38th parallel.

### July 1953 - Armistice:
- Truman replaced by Eisenhower -> he wanted to end the war.
- Stalins death made North Koreans and China less confident.
- Border didnt change much.

# Methods of Containment Used:

### Alliances:
The USA would form these alliances in order to enclose the communist countries and suppress them.

As payback these countries would get money and arms.

- [[SEATO]] - 1954
- [[CENTO]] - 1955

These two alliances triggered the [[Warsaw Pact]].

### [[The Arms Race]]:
Both sides entered into an arms race and eventually reached weapons of such capability that war would end up catastrophically for both countries.

So even threatening the use of such weapons would make a huge statement.
