The vietcong were a grouping of peasants under Ho Chi Minh which aimed to eliberate South Vietnam.
People who didnt support them were faced with terror whilst people whom encouraged them were treated very respectfully.

## Tactics Used:
- Close quarter combat -> not allow USA to use their weapons.
- Guerrilla warfare -> small battles.
- Wear civil clothes.
- Terror with booby traps.
