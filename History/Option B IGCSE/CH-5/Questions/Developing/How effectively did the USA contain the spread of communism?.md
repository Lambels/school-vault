In this chapter we will look at the 3 main case studies: [[1950 - 1953, The Korean War]], [[1962, The Cuban Missile Crisis]], [[1955 - 1975, The Vietnam War]].

# What Have We Learned From Each Case Study:

## [[1950 - 1953, The Korean War]]:
### Why Did It Happen?
- USA's strongest ally in the far East, China has just fallen to communism. With their lost grip on China, they lost their grip on all the far East.
- Also USSR just tested its own nuclear bomb on 1949. USA no longer had that advantage.
- Communism was planing to spread to the far East via cominform.
- USA had to do something to make its policy of containment CLEAR.

### What Happened After?
- Succes for containment:
	- At the cost of many casualties they did contain communism up til the north.
	- Showed how disparate the USA was on the policy of containment. 
- Failure for containment:
	- North Korea remained hard line communist. With a very strong communist party.
	- The policy of containment had its limits which were shown in [[1950 - 1953, The Korean War]].
	- It also highlighted tensions amongst the USA government officials. How the extremists viewed Truman as weak whilst some seen him as reasonable.

## [[1962, The Cuban Missile Crisis]]:
### Why Did It Happen?
- To have a exchange card when bargaining with the Americans on the removing of missiles around USSR.
- Test the USA on their confidence in a possible conflict.
- To close the missile gap. With missiles in their yard, it was very un likely for USA to attack first.

### What Happened After?
- Kennedy:
	- **Kennedy was now a world wide hero**, he stood up to Khrushchev and the threat of communism and made them back down.
	- **Kennedy also resisted the limited minded in his own government** and acted as a strong and calculated leader. When everyone wanted a full scale attack Kennedy halted and prevented a huge catastrophe from occurring. Yet again Kennedy is very strong.
	- **Kennedy secretly agreed to the removal of missiles from [[SEATO]].** The decision was *rushed* and NATO wasnt consulted. This was awkward for him and NATO, but was swept quickly under the rug when seeing what was avoided.
	- **Kennedy also ultimately accepted a communist Cuba in his backyard.**
- Khrushchev:
	- **Khrushchev highlighted in public his peace keeping qualities.**
	- **He managed to keep Cuba safe from USA**. Cuba was undoubted a very strong USSR communist checkpoint.
	- **He got USA to remove missiles from [[SEATO]]**. Although this wasnt public allot of bad relations formed between USA and NATO.
	- **He did look weak**. In everyones eyes he backed down in front of Capitalism, they were made to put the missiles on their decks of their ships so Americans can count them. This was massive humiliation.
	- **USSR lagged clearly behind in [[The Arms Race]]**. They had to go to such disparate means as to arm Cuba with ICBMS at a huge final cost. And yet they still backed down in front of USA.
	- **He was forced to resign**. Many commentators think [[1962, The Cuban Missile Crisis]] played a huge role.
- For the Cold War:
	- Now that both USSR and USA peeked into the atomic abyss and both flexed their muscles, they were both more laid off and acknowledged the dangers of MAD and made changes to make sure that MAD wont happen:
		- Permanent Hot Link phone line which was set up between the white house and the kremlin.
		- They both signed in 1963 a nuclear test ban. Limited the tests which was a huge step in the right direction.
	- Although USSR lacked behind in technology, the difference mad no *difference*. Since they both had capability of MAD. This is significant because for the rest of the war they both resented face to face contact.

## [[1955 - 1975, The Vietnam War]]:
### Why did it happen?
- The USA was very scared of [[The Domino Effect]].
- They were strong advocates of the Containment Policy.
- They had to justify their army budget.
- Laid back after [[1950 - 1953, The Korean War]].

### Happened After?
- This war was a huge failure for the policy of containment:
	- It failed military:
		- The power of simple Communism could face off even the strongest armies like the USA's.
	- It failed strategically:
		- Not only they didnt contain communism and let it spread to South Vietnam.
		- They also pushed the ideology deeper into peoples brain with exposing them to horrors like [[Opperation Rolling Thunder]] or the Hamlet Program.
		- [[Opperation Rolling Thunder]] also by 1975 changed Laos and Cambodia to communist after the bombs dropped on them by the capitalists.
	- It was a Propaganda disaster:
		- It got to the point where the new presidents would vouch to end the war when they came to power.
		- The war against communism wasnt so moral after the Vietnam War. Events like the [[My Lai Massacre]] - March 16 1968 raised some hard questions and protests back home.
		- The draft inequality was also a huge problem in the system.
		- Questions like were all raised after [[Tet Offensive]]:
			- What are we fighting for?
			- Could this money be used in other ways?
			- Why is there a draft inequality?
