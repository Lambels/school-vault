# METADATA:
- One of the most important occurrences in the cold war.
- Happened around 1962.

# Origins of the Cuban Missile Crisis:

### The arms race and nuclear deterrence:
Throughout the 1960s the USA and USSR were locked into an arms race, they were continuously trying to one up each other by creating a more deadly weapon with a higher range, etc ... .

They spied on each other and now both had enough mutual weapons for **MAD**.

Both superpowers were in alliances, especially USA, which had missiles planted very close to the other. USA had [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]] whilst USSR will try to get hold of Cuba.

## The Cuban Revolution:

### Before:
- Cuba was a dictator ships under Batista.
	- It was supported by USA.
	- Opposed communism.
- Batista was unpopular in Cuba.

### After:
- Fidel Castro overthrows Batista.
- Castro nationalises allot of American businesses.
	- Provided the land to Cuban peasants -> more popularity
- Cuban exiles which fled to USA formed powerful groups in USA which exerted pressure on USA to do something about.

### The USA Response:
- Authorised CIA to get involved (June 1960).
- CIA provided funds to Cuban Exiles.
- Damage sugar plantations.
- Stream on tv anti castro documentaries.
- American businesses refused to work with cuban businessmen which were using oil from ussr.

### Castros Response:
- He assured Americans in Cuba they are safe.
- Cuba allied with Soviets.
- Received 100 million $ from soviets for economic aid.
- Castro be-ginned receiving arms from Soviets.

## The Bay of Pigs Invasion:
- John F. Kennedy broke off diplomatic relationships with Cuba. Castro thought they were preparing for an invasion *he was right*.

- John F. Kennedy supplied arms, equipment and transport for 1400 anti-Castro exiles to invade Cuba. They did so in The Bay of Pigs.

### Conclusion Of The Invasion:
> It was a complete failure.

Because:
- US intelligence was completely wrong, cuban people didnt join the revolution.
- Cuban services knew the invasion was coming.
- Lack of secrecy in USA services -> USA couldnt deny involvement.
- Poor links between US departments.
- Insufficient Spanish speaking staff.

These Showed that:
- USA was unwilling to get directly involved in Cuba.
- Made Castro and Khrushchev very suspicious of us Policy.
- It showed that USA was weak. (Source 16 In Book (109))
