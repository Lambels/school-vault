# METADATA:
### Fighting The Japanese:
They treated the Vietnamese people horribly, they set up the [[Viet Minh]] to fight the Japanese. After the second world war, the [[Viet Minh]] entered Hanoi and declared independence.

### Fighting The French:
After the end of the war in 1945 the French came back to conquer Vietnam again. The [[Viet Minh]] ruled the north and the french the south.

Ho was supported by the Chinese, which were communist.
USA responded by helping the ones opposing the communists (French) - they poured 500 mil $.

The French pulled out of Vietnam after 9 years of fighting rendering Vietnam communist. *theoretically*

# The USA Respond:
*to the defeat of the french*

Ironically the same way that the USA criticised the USSR for not holding free elections in Eastern Europe, they did a similar thing.

They blocked the elections in Vietnam for occurring in the first place.
They tried to prevent [[The Domino Effect]] from occurring.
They were laid back because of past events like [[1950 - 1953, The Korean War]] which were successes.
In the same time they were ashamed from [[1962, The Cuban Missile Crisis]] and didnt want to back down this time.
They were pumping

### Financial Support To Diem:
- Americans boosted Diem to be the leader of South Vietnam (to oppose communism).
- Diems regime was very unpopular and corrupt.
- Diem was bitterly anti-communist (always supported by USA).
- He was very upperclass.
- He was a christian and showed no respect towards the buddhists.
- USA sent 16. bil $

## Hamlet Programme:
This was an attempt and response to the creation of the [[Viet Cong]] by the USA to popularise the South Vietnameze and move the people away from the [[Viet Cong]].

They wanted to move peasants from [[Viet Cong]] territory to South Vietnamese territory. The Americans supplied building materials, money, food and equipment for villagers to build houses and farms.

The plan backfired:
- The peasants resented it.
- Corrupt politicians put the money in their pockets and nothing was built.

## US Involvement increases:
