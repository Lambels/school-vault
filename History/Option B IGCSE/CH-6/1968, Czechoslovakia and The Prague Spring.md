# METADATA:
- Khrushchev outed from power.
- Replaced by Brezhnev.
- Czechoslovakia was posing a similar problem to USSR as [[1956, Hungary]] did.

# What happened?
*Throughout the 1960's a new trend / mood developed in Czechoslovakia.*

## New Leader:
- In 1967 old Stalinist leader was replaced by Dubcek.
- He proposed the idea of 'communism with a human face'.
- He believed in:
	- communism. (he was a committed communist)
	- communism dindnt have to be so restrictive.
	- a reduction in the activity of the secret police.
	- an increase in freedom of speech.
- He had learned his lessons from [[1956, Hungary]] and didnt make vouches such as:
	- leaving the [[Warsaw Pact]].
	- leaving [[Comecon]].

## New ideas:
- As the censorship eased and freedom of speech was more open and permissive allot of new opinions and critiques began to rise. This period was known as the 'Prague Spring'.
- The questions and critiques which raised were:
	- criticise failings of the communist rule.
	- expose corruption.
	- ask awkward questions about the events in the countries recent past.
	- ideas of allowing a new party of the Social Democrats to rival the Communist Party.

# How did the USSR respond?
- The communist leaders were afraid of the ideas and criticism which would arise around the world about communism.
- Brezhnev came under pressure from East Germany and Poland leaders to deal with Dubcek.
- Throughout the summer, the USSR tried several tactics to slow Dubcek down:
	- To intimidate the Czechs, the Polish, Russian and East Germany troops did military exercises along the Czech border.
	- Though about imposing economic sanctions, like not exporting wheat to the Czechs. Ruled out quickly because the Czechs would ask for help from the West if so.
	- In July the USSR held a summit conference with the Czechs. Dubcek agreed to not allow a new Social Democrat Party. However he insisted in keeping most of his reforms.
- In August 1968 soviet tanks entered Czechoslovakia to the amazement of everybody. There was little resistance and Dubcek was removed from power.
- Proved that 'communism with a friendly face' couldnt exist during those times.

## Outcomes:
- Dubcek (unlike Nagy whom was executed) was slowly removed from power in any communist point of view.
- Photos showing Dubcek as a leader were censored.
- The freedom of speech was a big opponent to all communist leaders throughout Europe (especially Eastern Germany + Soviet Union).
	- They feared that their people would demand the same amount of freedom Dubcek gave.
- [[Brezhnev Doctrine]].
