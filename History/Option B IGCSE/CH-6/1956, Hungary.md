# METADATA:
- Stalin dead - 1953.
- Khrushchev rose up to power of USSR - 1955.
- [[Warsaw Pact]] - Just signed in 1955.
- Till now Hungary was lead by Matyas Rakosi - a hard line, soviet controlled communist leader.
- The Hungarians hated the restrictions placed on them:
	- No freedom of speech.
	- Fear of the secret police.
	- The presence of thousands USSR officials.
	- They had to pay for the Soviet forces in Hungary.

# What happened?
*What was the actual issue with Hungary towards the USSR?*

## Opposition and Protests:
- In 1956 a group within the communist party in Hungary started opposing Matyas Rakosi.
- Matyas Rakosi appealed to Khrushchev for help demanding the arrest for 400 opposing leaders.
	- For Khrushchev it was getting clear that Rakosi wasnt a fit leader anymore.
- Khrushchev answered by retiring Rakosi for 'health reasons'.

### New leader:
- Erno Gero was put in place of Matyas Rakosi.
- He was not any better in the eyes of the Hungarian people.
- The discontent of the Hungarians reached a peak when on 23 October a statue of Stalin was pulled down in Budapest at a student demonstration.

## Reforms and further Plans:
- The USSR allowed the formation of a new government under the well respected Imre Nagy.
- Soviet personal and tanks which were stationed in Hungary since WW2 began retreating.
- Hungarians created thousands of local councils to replace previous Soviet power.

## Further Plans:
- Nagy's Government began to make plans and democratic votes.
- It would restore national farmland to private ownership.
- It would hold democratic votes.
- It wanted total soviet army removal from Hungary.
- Planed on leaving the [[Warsaw Pact]].
- Declare Hungary neutral in the Cold War struggle between the East and the West.
	- Hope that Eisenhower would them if necessary with troops and arms.

# Response by the USSR:
*all the reforms being created spilled over the soviets limit*
- Initially Khrushchev seamed open to accept some reforms.
- However when he heard that Nagy planned to leave the [[Warsaw Pact]] he sent thousands of soviet soldiers and tanks in Budapest.
	- Remember that the [[Warsaw Pact]] has just been created, if Hungary wouldve left this early it wouldve showed how weak the ties really were between the communist countries.
		- The [[Warsaw Pact]] was a response to [[NATO]] so it had to be very strong and trustable by USSR.
	- They were also scared that is Hungary left the [[Warsaw Pact]] then it could lead to [[The Domino Effect]] and other countries leaving and expressing their resentment towards the movement.
- 2 weeks of bitter fighting followed, with officially 3000 Hungarians and 1000 Russians dead.
	- Airports captured.
	- Highway junctions blocked.
	- 200,000 Hungarians fled to Austria.
- Western powers criticised the USSR but didnt act physically on the matter.

## Outcome:
- Khrushchev placed Kadar in place of Nagy.
- Nagy executed.
- Kadar took several months to crush the resistance all resistance.
	- 35,000 anti communist activists arrested.
	- 300 executed.
- He quietly implemented reforms demanded by the Hungarian people, **but never addressed the elephant in the room - [[Warsaw Pact]]**
