# METADATA:
- Happened in 1961.
- Kennedy elected as president in 1961.
- Caused a massive Brain Drain.

# The root problem with Berlin:
- Berlin was a very important propaganda trophy for both sides. (point of prestige)
	- They both fought hard battles for it, would be a shame to lose it now.
- Berlin was also a capitalist beacon in the middle of communism, allot of money was poured into Berlin to make it look like the best capitalist country.
	- Shops full of goods.
	- Much better living standards.
	- Freedom.
	- Variety.
- Berlin had also allot of West propaganda which was now accessible to all of the communists.
- Berlin also had no border and again was **capitalist**:
	- People who were smart werent really valued in communist countries.
	- They could go to Berlin and just leave which they couldnt normally do along the iron curtain. (Brain Drain - All skilled workers were leaving.)
	- They could also use the stronger currency in the West Germany.
	- They could buy things more accessible in capitalist countries and sell them to the communist secretive countries.
	- They could watch the Western TV.

# The solution:
- When Kennedy came to power Khrushchev wanted to bully Kennedy for his inexperience and demanded that Kennedy **removes US troops from the city**.
- Kennedy refuses.
- Early in the morning, the next day, East Germany soldiers erected a barbed wire barrier along the frontier of West and East Berlin.
- Quickly replaced by a concrete wall.
- Guarded by armed soldiers which would shoot.
- One space kept open: **Checkpoint Charlie**.
- Official name of Berlin wall: **Anti Fascist Protection Rampart**.

# Outcomes:
- Some people cheered the war.
- Kennedy called it a better solution then war.
- Harsh tensions yet again avoided at Checkpoint Charlie where Soviet and Western tanks had an intense standoff.
- The wall stayed, and became a symbol of yet again division between the West and the East.
- The communist called it a wall of protection (Anti Fascist Protection Rampart).
- The west called it a prison wall.
- Propaganda failure for the communists.
