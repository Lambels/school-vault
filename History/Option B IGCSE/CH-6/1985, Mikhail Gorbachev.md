# METADATA:
- Gorbachev became leader of the USSR in 1985.
- He was a reformist.
- He was a persuasive speaker.
- In 1990 he was awarded The Nobel Prize for peace.
- He was a weird mix between: optimist, realist and idealist.
- **Realist:**
	- He could see that USSR was in a horrible state.
	- Its economy was at the ground.
	- It was spending to much money in [[The Arms Race]].
- **Optimist:**
	- He believed that a reformed communist system could give people pride in their country.
	- He didnt intend to dismantle communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe but wanted to reform it radically.
- **Idealist:**
	- He was a proud Russian and devoted Communist and didnt like that people didnt trust and werent loyal towards the state.
	- He believed that communism should make people more comfortable in the country.
	- He didnt like that Russians had bad living conditions.
	- He didnt like that Russian factories were not producing quality goods.

# Policies:
- He had a much different view then Brezhnev.
- In March he called in all the leader in the [[Warsaw Pact]], he announced his 2 main policies.
	- This was a massive turning points.

### We wont intervene:
- Made it clear that the satellite states were now responsible for their own fates.
- No military help would be provided by the USSR.
- Most of the [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders were old-style, hardline communist leaders and didnt believe in what he said.

### You have to reform:
- He also made it clear that they had to reform their countries.
- He still believed that communism would survive and even provide goods which would counter the west counter.
- They wanted to renew communism in the east so that it can match the goods offered by the west.
- The hardline communist leaders yet again critiqued his view. 

# Gorbachev Reforms:
- Although he had to be careful since he couldve faced great opposition from the hardline communist leaders inside his own gov. yet he still gradually declared his policies.
- Note that these 2 reforms applied to USSR only, yet they invited other countries to follow along.
- All these were never seen for circa 50 years from the tense USSR. This was a massive turning point.

### Glasnost:
- Transparency throughout the gov.
- Permission for open debate on gov. policies.
- Honesty in facing problems.

### Perestroika:
- Allowed market forces in the soviet economy.
- Factory owners could now make a profit.
- For the first time in 60 years it wasnt illegal to buy or sell for a profit.

### Reduce defence spendings:
- [[The Arms Race]] was a huge money sink for the already poor USSR, he reduced the budget of that.
- After 50 years of war footing, the size of The Red Army also shrank.

### Improve international relations:
- Removed soviet troops from the afghan war which was very costly yet un-winnable.
- He also talked in a public speech about USSR's attitude moving onwards to foreign relations ships:
	- International trust would increase.
	- Co-operation would also increase.
	- USSR will be more open.

### Gorbachev and President Reagan:
- He had a similar policy to [[Truman Doctrine]].
- He criticised the control over eastern Europe by USSR.
- Reagan's roughness towards Gorbachev helped him in a way:
	- It was clear that the military war between the West and East was lost, so was [[The Arms Race]]. He used this as a way to get his reforms to decrease army spending through.
	- Reagan got quite good with Gorbachev himself, this led to better relation ships -> USSR felt less threatened -> less need for USSR control over eastern Europe.
