# METADATA:
- Poland was full of protests.
- Generally about living standards not to overthrow the gov.
- First half of the 70s Polish gov preformed well (no tensions).
- Second half had the worst year for Polish industry (1979).

### What happened after the second half of 1970s.
1. Gov increases the price of meat. (July 1980)
2. Workers at the Gdansk shipyard, led by [[Lech Walesa]] put forward 21 demands for the gov. and formed a free trade union called Solidarity. (August 1980)
3. The gov. agreed to all 21 of Solidarities demands.
4. Solidarities membership grew to 3.5 mil.
5. Grew to 7 mil, now recognised by the Polish gov.
6. Membership reached peak at 9.4 million, more then 1/3 of the polish workforce.

# Reasons for Solidarity Success:
- The union was strongest in heavy industries such as shipbuilding. A general strike in these industries would devastate Poland.
- In the early stages, Solidarity wasnt seen as a threat for the Communist Party since 30% of the Communist Party was in Solidarity.
	- Lech Walesa was very careful in talking with the gov. He worked to avoid creating  a dispute which might bring in the Soviet Union.
- The union was immensely popular. Almost half of the workers belonged to solidarity. [[Lech Walesa]] was seen as a folk hero.
- Solidarity had the support of the Catholic Church. The catholic church was very strong in Poland.
- The gov. was playing for time, hoping that Solidarity would break down. Meanwhile they were devising plans for Martial Law.
- Very much support for the West. Far reaching fields.

# Martial Law:
- In feb. 1981 the situation changed, the civilian prime minister resined and the leader of the army took over, his name was General Jaruzelski.
- They negotiated for 9 tense months and after the relations broke down and the communist gov. acted.
	- Brezhnev ordered that the Red Army would carry out training campaigns outside the Polish Border.
	- Jaruzelski carried out Marshal Law.
		- He put [[Lech Walesa]] and 10,000 other Solidarity leaders in prison.
		- He suspended Solidarity.

# Reasons for Crushing Solidarity:
- Solidarity was acting as a political party. The gov. declared that solidarity had secrete meetings trying to set up a new provisional government. This was acting against the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]].
- Poland was already sinking into chaos. Almost all Poles felt the impact of food shortages. Rationing was introduced. Unemployment was rising. Wages were increasing slower then Inflation.
- Solidarity itself was also tumbling into chaos. It was unorganised, there were many factions inside solidarity, they put to much pressure on the communist gov.

# The significance of Solidarity:
1. Solidarity highlighted the failure of communism to providing a good standard of living. 
2. It highlighted inefficiently and corruption.
3. It showed that some organisations actually could resist a communist government.
4. It showed - [[People Power]] could work.
